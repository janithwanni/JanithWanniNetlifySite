She entered the room  
His heart leaped forward  
To break free  
From the cage  
Built over forgotten tears  
His brain went cold  
Not with sorrow  
But with anger  
And his feet  
Took him away  
Away from the room  
Away from the misery averted  
Into the loneliness  
Where memories burned   
In an undying hearth  
Memories of old times past  
When her presence   
Sparked his entire soul  
And brought out  
All that is good inside him

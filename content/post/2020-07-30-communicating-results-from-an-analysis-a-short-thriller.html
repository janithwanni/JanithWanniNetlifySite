Summary: One of my experiences in telling a story with data and the challenges associated with the journey

<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Most of us here have their own horror stories of statistical consulting written in different forms with different villains. This is one of my stories.</p>
<p><em>The names and places have been replaced with generic names that I came up to safeguard myself and everyone else who worked on this project with me.</em></p>
</div>
<div id="the-project" class="section level2">
<h2>The project</h2>
<p>I received the chance to work in this project through my girlfriend who was working in a production branch of a digital marketing agency (hereon referred to as EyeAngle).
The project was simple.
EyeAngle has been working with a client (hereon referred to as University of Liverpool) for a long time and the time had come for UoL to take in a new set of candidates into their environment. EyeAngle had worked on producing videos for social media content such as testimonials, teaser trailers and together with the parent company EyeAngle+ had run a campaign to recruit more candidates into UoL. Now the time has come to take the data that was collected in the process and analyse to present to the client of the success of the project.
That was what I knew at first glance and I accepted the opportunity (this was in a period where everyone was quarantining in the middle of a pandemic, and I needed a project that was exciting as this to keep myself sane)</p>
<p>Now before beginning on the task, I had to take a look at what sort of data was available for me. The supervisor of this project (hereon referred to as the Provost) informed me with the data that they have collected and what are the data that needs to be collected.</p>
<div id="the-data" class="section level3">
<h3>The data</h3>
<div id="googly-data" class="section level4">
<h4>Googly Data</h4>
<p>To explain the sources of data, one must get to know the story behind how the data was collected. And here is where Google Analytics come into play.</p>
<p><em>insert explanation about what Google analytics is</em></p>
<p>From the start of the campaign social media content has been posted on two platforms. Facebook and Instagram.
Each social media content that was posted during the campaign had a link for potential candidates to sign up for the interview. The links had Google Analytics tracking attached with it (in the case of Instagram the links were all funnelled through the bio and in the case of Facebook the links with tracking codes were shortened and added as part of the post content). From that source a variety of data was collected. I didn’t receive access to the direct Google Analytics data because that would have been risky. Instead I received access to a Google Data Studio dashboard.</p>
<p><em>insert explanation about what Google Data Studio is</em></p>
<p>Now from this dashboard I had to slowly collect data by setting the date and then downloading the CSV’s related to each of the three graphs that were present.</p>
<p><em>insert screencap of the Google Data Studio Dashboard</em></p>
<p>After downloading a few files I realised that combining all of these into dataframe is going to be a massive collection of <code>rbind</code> codes. Therefore I googled a bit about how R gives out contents of a directory and lo and behold it was a list. <strong>quickly loads purrr library</strong>
How convenient, I can simply put each of the three CSV’s that come under each date into a folder named with that date and then combine them all together by mapping through the list of files. The result was the following code.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>application_conversion_rate &lt;- map_dfr(dir_ls(&quot;raw_data/&quot;),
                                       ~ read_csv(dir_info(.x)$path[1]) %&gt;% 
                                         mutate(date = gsub(&quot;raw_data/&quot;,&quot;&quot;,.x)))
applications &lt;- map_dfr(dir_ls(&quot;raw_data/&quot;),
                        ~ read_csv(dir_info(.x)$path[2]) %&gt;% 
                          mutate(date = gsub(&quot;raw_data/&quot;,&quot;&quot;,.x)))
campaign_data &lt;- map_dfr(dir_ls(&quot;raw_data/&quot;),
                         ~ read_csv(dir_info(.x)$path[3]) %&gt;% 
                           mutate(date = gsub(&quot;raw_data/&quot;,&quot;&quot;,.x)))

write_csv(application_conversion_rate,&quot;combined_data/application_conversion_rate.csv&quot;)
write_csv(applications,&quot;combined_data/applications.csv&quot;)
write_csv(campaign_data,&quot;combined_data/campaign_data.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>After inspecting the final combined dataset I gained an understanding of what sort of data I have with me right now. In summary, I know in a particular date how many users clicked on the signup link on a SM post and then how many of them signed up using that link, in addition I also knew where these users came from and whether they came from an advertisement or simply from a SM post.
So that was one dataset under my belt. I felt like a coding ninja using purrr, and as all good things go, my dopamine levels were about to make a massive hit after encountering the next source of data.</p>

<div id="super-data" class="section level4">
<h4>Super Data</h4>
<p>Remember how I mentioned paid advertisements? well there was the next catch. The provost at the start of the project informed me that I will not be working alone in this project, and that there will be two people from EyeAngle working with me. Those two were simply my girlfriend and a really close friend of hers. Both of them were competent in R, Excel and were excellent content writers. But here I had the next problem that I never faced before.</p>
</div>
<div id="pitfall-1-collaborative-google-slides-with-r" class="section level4">
<h4>Pitfall #1: Collaborative Google Slides with R</h4>
<p>At the time being the only option was to use Rstudio cloud as the option but the issue that came up next was that the final report needed to be made in Google Slides for several reasons such as convienience, collaborative real time editing and suggesting etc. This I knew would become a tedious two step process, as I would have to run the R script locally and then create the graph and <code>ggsave</code> it and then paste it on to the Google Slide and adjust it accordingly. There was no other option for me but to stick with this method.</p>
<p>Moving forward from that the next task that the provost set forward for me was to collect data about the Facebook ad campaigns. There I learned about another tool on collecting data called Supermetrics.</p>
<p><em>insert explanation on what supermetrics is</em></p>
<p>Supermetrics is free for use as a trial for 14 days and since I was supposed to submit this within less than 14 days I was able to use the free version as the provost told me. As per his instructions I set up a Google Sheet and then started by adding the Supermetrics addon to Google Sheets. It took me and the rest of the team two days to completely understand how the queries run from Supermetrics and what were the resulting data coming from. This was where knowing a bit about SQL helped to underestand what Supermetrics was trying to bring and from where. Finally after a few trial and error and a bundle of extra sheets in the Sheets workbook we managed to get the following data.</p>
<p><em>Work in progress</em></p>

# To my dear muse,

Even a glance at your divine eyes, a glimpse of your smile, and a swish of your hair as you race past me, makes my heart skip a beat.   
I would not have been able to go forward as all of my focus would have been lost on your beauty.   
I am but a humble fool, an instrument of the gods put in this world to describe the most grandiose personification of beauty that the heavens have placed on this earth.    
Like the breeze carrying the scent of spring and bringing memories to all, unknowingly to you, my dear muse, memories and reminders of you are always ever so present in every breath I take.    
Oh, what a cruel punishment for a humble fool as I am, to be forever captivated in the presence of such beauty, only to be forever unnoticed in the eyes of divine beauty.    
The sweet melody of your laughter will always bring the warmth of a fireplace in the coldest winters.   
Bless my poor heart, my dear muse, I am simply in love with you and you will never know how my eyes see your beauty.

# To the smile that touched my heart, 

Be gentle with my frail naive heart. The wings of butterflies are gentle as it is. There is a small light left inside my fractured heart and it burns as brightly as it can. It will give you all the warmth you need on your coldest nights and a bright campfire on a summer night. That is all I can give. In turn, I only ask you to be gentle with my crumbling heart. My mind wanders in worlds that I built and I don't know if I want them to be true. I write tales of rose colour, only the grim dark reality of life to pull the rug under my feet.  I imagine walking beside you and observing your laughter, seeing your eyes squint with joy, and hearing the tone of your voice change as you share your deepest fears and sorrows. Oh how much I wish it to be true, even though the reality is looming behind me to remind me of how all of this will go. So be gentle with my heart but never lose the smile that you have. For every time you smile, the world becomes a bit more colourful.

Oh, how the heart woes for which might never be attainable. That which cannot be attainable can still be achieved. How fickle and naive my heart is. I have no strength to have someone to be close to me,. Yet my heart skips a beat even at the sight and thought of her. Why oh why does my heart run wild with such innocence. What is that my child-like heart speaks of? Someone interesting, someone caring and someone beautiful, and she is all of that.

# To the child within me,

My little boy,   
I see your heart leap in joy at the sight of her,   
I see the smile that blossoms on the corners of your cheeks unknown to you,   
Take care my little one   
For I know how much you will care for her,   
For I know how your world revolves around her,   
But alas my boy,   
When the storm ends,   
and the promised rainbow is nowhere to be seen,   
Will she still be the same?   
Will you still be the same?   
and will she accept your offering?

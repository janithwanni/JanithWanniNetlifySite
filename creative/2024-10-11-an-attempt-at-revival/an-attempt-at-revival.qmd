# An attempt at revival

Perhaps there is some beauty to life,   

in all the strangers that we cross paths with   
where all their stories inspire us   
where their presence next to us brings a platonic warmth   
where our solemn goodbyes leave a bittersweet smile   

in all the moments of laughter   
where our eyes squint into darkness   
where our breaths fall rapidly   
where the sound of our laughter echoes   

in all the tiny picture perfect nature's paintings   
where we smile dreamily looking at palettes beyond our imagination   
where we reach for our phones to freeze the time, never to look back   
where we inhale and exhale the fragrances that the wind brings   

Perhaps there is some beauty in life,   
even though everytime I find no beauty in life   
each time I consider my demise   
as I wake from my slumber

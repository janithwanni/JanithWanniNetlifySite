Oh what a beautiful experience it is,    
to be a child again,    

As I cradle my little child,    
after letting her run amok
or keeping her hidden and silent
for all these years

I can not help but feel a sense of glee
when I see her eyes light up
as she sees all these beautiful
and interesting and kind souls.

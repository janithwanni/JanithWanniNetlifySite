I am a simple man,    
pulled in different directions,    
by what I have preached.       
I say that the path to freedom,      
lies in staying in the present moment,           
But oh how I wish      
to have someone to share my life with.

I am but a child ,       
desparate for attention and connection.    
I am but a child,      
unwilling to put my attention if the reward is not fair enough.       
I wish I was a child,       
able to know when to rest and play.      
I wish I was a child,       
able to see the miracle of life afresh.      
I wish I was old,         
to know if everything worked out in the end.      
I wish I was dead,      
I take that back,        
I do not wish that,       
not when there are people who want me to stay.

_“Don’t put your loved ones on a pedestal_     
_Cause it will put a huge burden on them_     
_And sets unrealistic expectation”_      

That’s what they all say    
And truly a pedestal is not    
where she is right now   
In my eyes    

She is a part of my world    
And I’m a part of my world   

How can I restrict her to a pedestal    

When her laughter    
Echoes in my ears    
Just as the birds chirp in a gale    

When every where i lay my eyes on her    
Calms my heart    
And steadies my soul    

And when she speaks    
My mind and body     
Hums with her thoughts    

What purpose does a pedestal serve    
When her scent is in the air i breathe    
her warmth is in the gentle breeze i feel    
her love is in every speck of color I see     
Wherever I go

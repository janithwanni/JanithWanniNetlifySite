I understand   
The cracks and the thorns within   
in this ivory tower   
of my humble abode  

I understand   
The rot that festers within  
seeping upwards in tendrils  
from stone to the sky   

I understand  
The darkness that looms within  
crowded with monsters   
untold and unheard of  

But why   
does it still ache   
to be powerless   
with all the tools   
near my fingertips   
to banish asunder   
the cracks   
the thorns   
the rot   
the darkness   

Perhaps   
Knowing is not half the battle   
For what man   
would march in   
over others who failed   
to win a battle   
that they know fully well.

You feared it  
Despised it  
Loathed it  

You ran away  
Drowned your pain  
In puddles of laughter  
But never did the puddle  
Grow into a lake  

You flew away  
From puddle to puddle  
Wishing for a lake  
Only to fall  
With wings too tired  
All that was left  
Was solitude  
All avenues closed  
No where to flee  
But once inside  
The missing piece  
Was clear  
An ear for a voice  
Both from inside  

Puddles of laughter  
May never come  
But a small fountain  
Shall at least  
Pour the water  
To bring life  
From death

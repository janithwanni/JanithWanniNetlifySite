# Day 1: Ponies and Lies

_Straight away, I recognised the woman doting on her children as the bully from my high school._ I lowered the rim of my bucket hat hoping she wouldn't see my face. Two girls were sitting beside her both of them wearing shorts and "My Little Pony" t-shirts. Seeing the logos on their tees brought a visceral memory to the forefront of my mind, where I could see Brittney, my high school bully, munching on her gum while looking over her shoulder at the cover of my diary since I was a little girl.   
"Ew, you are still into those cringey ponies. Grow up bitch. Putting stickers on that stupid book won't hide the slutty things you are writing there, you fat whore" She scoffs as she walks away with her entourage. At the same time, I stare frozen on the spot noticing everyone's waves of laughter and wrinkled nose and brow magnified to an overwhelming state. The vision cuts to me in an unknown bathroom with tears in my eyes as I breathe in short gasps after Brittany's boyfriend Josh tried to grope me jeering "I heard from Brittany that you would be a good slut for anyone". And the vision settles into me in my bedroom writing into my diary, with tears staining the pages, "Why does everyone call me a slut when I haven't even held a guy's hand before?"    
It has been 20 years since I survived Brittany's reign during high school. And yet, I still froze on the spot when I saw her, half expecting her to look at me and start cackling at me with her daughters, pointing and laughing at me. I wasn't sure whether it was the run I just did or the series of visions that made me out of breath. Either way, I had to take a deep breath and rest my palms on my leggings to calm myself down.     
"I think that's enough running for today," I say as I tap the end on the smartwatch noticing that the distance was a metre shy of 5 kilometres even though I felt like I ran a lot more. My pace was at a moderate 5 minutes and I knew it needed to be improved a lot more if I was going to secure first place in the annual regional marathon after getting second place three years in a row.    
I tear my eyes away from the scene in front of me. "Mommy, mommy look my shirt is shining" I hear a little girl's shrill excitement from behind me. I peek behind my shoulder and hear "Aw that's beautiful sweetie, these ponies were mommy's favourite friend throughout mommy's life too, aren't they beautiful". I whip my head around to look back at Brittany and her daughters to see her giggling with her daughters sharing their joy of the ponies glinting in the sunlight.    
"I could settle this once and for all. I am an adult now. I do not have fear her any longer" I whisper to myself as my hands curl into fists. I walk up to Brittany and stand in front of her and her daughters blocking the sunlight falling on their faces. For a moment she looked puzzled at me squinting her eyes to look at who was standing in front of her.     
"I'm sorry do I know you from somewhere 'cause you look familiar." She cocks her head to the side with a bemused look.    
"Glad to see that you are finally owning up to enjoying My little pony, after bullying me for so long. How would you feel if your kids were called fat whores and groped at parties? Did you even think about how much it would affect the people around you?" The words flow from my mouth as if I was possessed by angry spirits that were sealed shut in a tomb for ages.   
"Oh..., Oh dear. You must have confused me for my twin sister. Are you talking about Brittany?" Her face darkens and the corners of her lips draw down in a sign of mild sadness.    
"Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I thought you were Brittany, I'm really sorry" My palm wraps around my mouth as I look at the entire face again in shock. I had recognised parts of her as my high school bully but there are subtle changes in her nose and ears that somewhat pointed to the alternative.    
"That's all right, it happens all the time. I don't think you heard the news I suppose? Yeah, you wouldn't be yelling at a random woman on the streets if you knew I guess. Brittany passed away a few months ago." She grimaced as the words left her mouth.   
The palm resting on my mouth clasped tighter as I took in a deep breath. "Oh my.. what happened? I'm so sorry I didn't know that happened."   
"It was sudden for us too. She had eloped with this drug dealer a few years ago. The only time we heard anything about her was when her body was found in a gang war site where two rival cartels had a shootout. It was shocking for us too." She said with a solemn grace and looked down.    
The story seemed outlandish but as I pieced together Brittany's dating history, it all seemed to make more sense.
"I'm absolutely stunned to hear that. I'm really sorry again for the confusion" I say as I select my words with caution. It was hard going through what Brittany did to me. At the same time, she did not deserve to die in such a tragic way. "I should get going back home. I will drop by later to properly offer my condolences." I mutter as I turn away from the scene for the second time.   
"That's all right sweetie, you don't have to really" She smiled weakly and stared into the distance.
I could not muster the energy to reply back so I decided to slowly trudge my way back home.   
"You did good sweeties, both of you didn't speak while mommy was talking to an adult" I could Brittany's sister cooing to her daughters as I walked by.    
"But mommy your name is Brittany isn't it?" The youngest daughter asks loudly from the edge of the seat.

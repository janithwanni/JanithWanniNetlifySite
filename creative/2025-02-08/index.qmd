# Day 1: Ponies and Lies

_Straight away, I recognised the woman doting on her children as the bully from my high school._ I lowered the rim of my bucket hat hoping she wouldn't see my face. Two girls were sitting beside her both of them wearing shorts and "My Little Pony" t-shirts. Seeing the logos on their tees brought a visceral memory to the forefront of my mind, where I could see Brittney, my high school bully, munching on her gum while looking over her shoulder at the cover of my diary since I was a little girl.   
"Ew, you are still into those cringey ponies. Grow up bitch. Putting stickers on that stupid book won't hide the slutty things you are writing there, you fat whore" She scoffs as she walks away with her entourage. At the same time, I stare frozen on the spot noticing everyone's waves of laughter and wrinkled nose and brow magnified to an overwhelming state. The vision cuts to me in an unknown bathroom with tears in my eyes as I breathe in short gasps after Brittany's boyfriend Josh tried to grope me jeering "I heard from Brittany that you would be a good slut for anyone". And the vision settles into me in my bedroom writing into my diary, with tears staining the pages, "Why does everyone call me a slut when I haven't even held a guy's hand before?"    
It has been 20 years since I survived Brittany's reign during high school. And yet, I still froze on the spot when I saw her, half expecting her to look at me and start cackling at me with her daughters, pointing and laughing at me. I wasn't sure whether it was the run I just did or the series of visions that made me out of breath. Either way, I had to take a deep breath and rest my palms on my leggings to calm myself down.     
"I think that's enough running for today," I say as I tap the end on the smartwatch noticing that the distance was a metre shy of 5 kilometres even though I felt like I ran a lot more. My pace was at a moderate 5 minutes and I knew it needed to be improved a lot more if I was going to secure first place in the annual regional marathon after getting second place three years in a row.    
I tear my eyes away from the scene in front of me. "Mommy, mommy look my shirt is shining" I hear a little girl's shrill excitement from behind me. I peek behind my shoulder and hear "Aw that's beautiful sweetie, these ponies were mommy's favourite friend throughout mommy's life too, aren't they beautiful". I whip my head around to look back at Brittany and her daughters to see her giggling with her daughters sharing their joy of the ponies glinting in the sunlight.    
"I could settle this once and for all. I am an adult now. I do not have fear her any longer" I whisper to myself as my hands curl into fists. I walk up to Brittany and stand in front of her and her daughters blocking the sunlight falling on their faces. For a moment she looked puzzled at me squinting her eyes to look at who was standing in front of her.     
"I'm sorry do I know you from somewhere 'cause you look familiar." She cocks her head to the side with a bemused look.    
"Glad to see that you are finally owning up to enjoying My little pony, after bullying me for so long. How would you feel if your kids were called fat whores and groped at parties? Did you even think about how much it would affect the people around you?" The words flow from my mouth as if I was possessed by angry spirits that were sealed shut in a tomb for ages.   
"Oh..., Oh dear. You must have confused me for my twin sister. Are you talking about Brittany?" Her face darkens and the corners of her lips draw down in a sign of mild sadness.    
"Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I thought you were Brittany, I'm really sorry" My palm wraps around my mouth as I look at the entire face again in shock. I had recognised parts of her as my high school bully but there are subtle changes in her nose and ears that somewhat pointed to the alternative.    
"That's all right, it happens all the time. I don't think you heard the news I suppose? Yeah, you wouldn't be yelling at a random woman on the streets if you knew I guess. Brittany passed away a few months ago." She grimaced as the words left her mouth.   
The palm resting on my mouth clasped tighter as I took in a deep breath. "Oh my.. what happened? I'm so sorry I didn't know that happened."   
"It was sudden for us too. She had eloped with this drug dealer a few years ago. The only time we heard anything about her was when her body was found in a gang war site where two rival cartels had a shootout. It was shocking for us too." She said with a solemn grace and looked down.    
The story seemed outlandish but as I pieced together Brittany's dating history, it all seemed to make more sense.
"I'm absolutely stunned to hear that. I'm really sorry again for the confusion" I say as I select my words with caution. It was hard going through what Brittany did to me. At the same time, she did not deserve to die in such a tragic way. "I should get going back home. I will drop by later to properly offer my condolences." I mutter as I turn away from the scene for the second time.   
"That's all right sweetie, you don't have to really" She smiled weakly and stared into the distance.
I could not muster the energy to reply back so I decided to slowly trudge my way back home.   
"You did good sweeties, both of you didn't speak while mommy was talking to an adult" I could hear Brittany's sister cooing to her daughters as I walked by.    
"But mommy your name is Brittany isn't it?" The youngest daughter asks loudly from the edge of the seat.   


# Day 2: The cycle goes on

_Nervously, she opened the door to the abandoned house._ The door creaked forward on rusted hinges and the golden light from the evening sun flowed into the house. Standing at the doorway, she saw a narrow passageway that stretched out beyond the safety of the light and two large doors on either side of the entrance. Taking a deep breath of the mouldy stale air she patted around in the dark around the edge of the doorframe to find a tiny switch. Flicking it on did nothing however as the passageway was still only illuminated by the sun behind her. She sighed with an audible "Oh dear" and fumbled around in her purse to find her mobile. Flipping open the tattered leather case she presses on the small button on the side, the center and the two buttons that are connected together. But the screen remained pitch black. "Must be something wrong with these phones." she grumbles as she shoves the phone back into the purse. With a shake of her head she steps forward, and closes the door behind her. The darkness engulfed her with only a strip of light visible far away at the bottom of the passageway. She could not see clearly from where it was coming from and with heavy steps of foot and wood, she limped forward with her cane to the source of the light.    
The light was spilling from under a door on the side of the passageway. From behind the door faint music was being played and she could a voice having a rushed conversation in a language she didn't understand. She reached for the door knob and twisted it to realise the door was locked. As soon as she twisted the door knob the conversation stopped and the music faded away. "He doesn't want to be disturbed I guess" she thinks to herself "Must be busy with studies and catching up with his family back home". After a while the music and the conversation flowed again and so she turned around to walk back to the front of the passageway where she knew the living room would be at.     
From the tiny slivers of light creeping into the room from the blinds on the windows she could make out the outline of the couch she usually falls asleep in. Slowly after lowering herself on to the couch she puts her cane away and grabs a blanket from the nearby chair as she gently lays down on the sofa with the blanket wrapped around her. A slight cough crawls in through her throat and one after another several long drawn out coughs kept piling in. With each cough she could feel her heartbeat waver and settle, and once her breath settles she gently closes her eyes to fall asleep.     
When she opened her eyes again she was at the doorway to this house. Nervously, she opened the door to the abandoned house. The door creaked forward on its hinges and the golden light from the evening sun flowed into the passageway. Stepping into the house she closed the door behind her as usual knowing that none of her light sources were there and that she would have to rely on her memory of the place. Looking around she could see that the sliver of light at the bottom of the passageway has opened up. The light from inside the room has spilled onto the passageway illuminating the entire house with a tiny soft glow. "Wonder what he must be up to" she thinks to herself as she steps forward to the light. At that moment the door to her left opens up and a boy in her mid twenties steps out and walks past her. He did not acknowledge her presence and simply walked forward towards the light. "Must be busy as always working on his studies" she smiles and walks over to the couch in the living room to her right. She lies down on the couch keeping the cane to the side.    
As the line of coughs began to creep in she could hear from afar the boy talking loudly. "Gosh mom you wouldn't believe how bad this house is, even after grandma passed away I can still smell her horrible old smell around the house. Like right now even I smelled it near the doorway. I don't know how long I can keep staying at this hell hole with doors being opened randomly and broken switches being flipped on randomly."    
When she opened her eyes again she was at the doorway to this house. Nervously, she opened the door to the abandoned house.    

# Day 3: Love and Fate

You never know who you'll bump into at a funeral. The words of my best friend were stuck in my head as I looked at the scenery of the countryside passing behind me. There is no possible reality where this funeral would be eventful. It was saddening to hear that Grandma passed away unexpectedly when she was getting excited to celebrate her birthday next month. I was at my workplace near dozing off when I received the phone call from my mom about the news. Since then it has been a whirlwind of packing and planning flights to arrive at my hometown. I was excited to sleep in my childhood bed after a long time but I was not enthusiastic at all about meeting my high school friends and close family. The houses started looming ahead of me as I realized how close I was to my destination. With a deep sigh I braced myself to the barrage of questions and supposed familiar faces I had to greet and recognize.
"It is quite sad to hear that she passed away, we were all excited with her to celebrate her 90th birthday party." A man who's face I could not recognize shook my hand while looking at me expectantly with solemn eyes. It was almost as if he was looking for a sign on my face showing how I too was excited about her birthday. "Yes it was hard to hear for us all as well. But I'm sure wherever she is, she would be still excited for everything the world has to offer". I smiled as the words flowed through my mouth as if I had practiced these eulogies beforehand. Truth be told, I did. I knew that everyone wanted to size me up and make me feel bad for moving out into the city after high school leaving behind most of my friends and family. They wanted to know if I still had an inkling of humanity and compassion left after moving to the big city. Truth be told, I did.
The man smiled widely bordering on ingenuity and moved along to talk with couple other colleagues he saw near the bar. My grandma always being the one to make things interesting had specifically requested alcohol to be served at her funeral in her will. As I scanned the bar area, I think my grandma knew what would soothe our family more than I would have been able to.
"Yoo, it's been a long time man, Justin right?" A deep voice came from the right side of me and I turned to come face to face with a tall muscular man who was offering his hand as an invitation for the 'bro hug' as they call it. " We were in the same class in high school, you remember right? I was the one trying to get that girl in our class from bullying you that one time. What was her name" He laughed and patted my back as we disengaged from the hug. For a solid second I was lost in a sea of memories. 
First came an image of a young girl with long black hair and deep brown eyes that would take anyone's breath away, at least it did for me. Lizzie was her name and the frown on her brow and the wrinkles on her nose indicated to only the disgust and loathing that she felt when she saw me. The reason for those emotions, I have never known, but I could only assume they were because I looked not that attractive and somehow I managed to be put in to the same class as her all through out highschool. Every year, friends would shuffle around between classes but for some god's entertainment I was kept in the same class as her every year. She would always be getting first place in her studies while I would be at the second place no matter how hard I tried. 'Fugly Justin always ending up burnt by Lizzie's sizzle' was the term that was spread around high school and she made sure that her sizzle would include a barrage of scoffs induced descriptions of my looks and my nerdy nature.
"Yeah I remember you clearly bro." I clearly did not. "Thanks to you it was a lot easier going through the last year with Lizzie going a bit extra for some reason on the bullying" I smile back politely pulling myself out of the memory lane that I was trapped in. "Haven't seen for a while now, hope she's doing okay". I mumble with a smile as a contribution to the conversation.
"Well yeah she went through some tough times with her divorce after the jerk of her husband cheated on her. We haven't seen her in ages and I doubt she would be here either" The man who's name I should know looked around as if he was hoping to find her among the crowd. "Anyways smell ya later bro. You have become hella ripped since you left high school man, you should tell me your workout routine someday. Fugly Justin looks like should be now called Fuck boy Justin haha" he walked away laughing at his own twist to the joke.
"I sure hope not to find her here today. I don't think I can handle interacting with her today." I sigh and relax my shoulders from the tension I had endured.
"Justin? Is that you?" The familiar female voice seemed like an echo from the memories that I witnessed. I whip my full body to the side to come face to face with the same deep brown eyes that I fell in love with all through out highschool. "Lizzie?" I croak.

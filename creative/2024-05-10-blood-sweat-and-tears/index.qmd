# Sang, sueur et larmes

I once met a painter.   
He only drew in the darkest of nights,   
under a faint candle light.    
He would take a good look at his canvas,   
and paint in thin strokes.    
At first I saw no color from his brush.   
But as he kept on driving the brush,    
deeper and deeper  
to his frail canvas   
lines of bright crimson red  
faint in the candlelight    
would appear on his canvas.   
He takes on a mad frenzy    
and draws more and more.    
Until his canvas is painted    
with thin crimson lines.    
And at the end     
he would sigh in peace.    
Only to take up the canvas again    
in the darkest of nights    
under a faint candle light.    
To paint on top of his old canvas,   
his frail canvas,    
filled with half dried crimson lines,     
“In pain I shall find peace”.

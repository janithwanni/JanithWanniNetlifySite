Look up above you  
And see the stars twinkling   
Every step you take  
They will be by your side  
Each little star is an angel  
A tiny little flame  
Struggling to burn bright  
Yet the angels  
Will burn with all their might   
To shine their light on to you  
The beauty of angels  
Lies in their path along side us  
Angels will guide you  
Keep you safe  
And provide you warmth 
And when you reach  
The one place  
that you always wanted to be at  
Then the angelâ€™s time is up  
With a satisfying sigh  
The tiny little flame  
Will no longer struggle to burn bright  
Angels come in to our lives  
To bring us to a good place  
After the deed is done  
Then the angel shall take their leav

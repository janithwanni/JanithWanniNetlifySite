I do not know how to structure this. But I want to pursue writing up things that that I learned from my every day happenings as sort of learned lessons for my future child to read and see that life isn't always linear. Everyone is understanding things and growing as they go in life. Perhaps I might merge this with the memoirs of a magpie and restructure it.

The weather is becoming more colder even though it's supposed to be the height of summer. Waking up was hard today as it was a nice cold Sunday morning and the tendency  to just roll over and sleep was too high. I had to promise myself that I would get out of bed at 07:15AM and show up to my laptop and keyboard to write this. 
When we are young promises mean a lot for us. It's a sign of putting trust on to others, and also a way to receive trust on to yourself. When you are young, you will make promises to others and others will make promises to you as well. At first you would expect those around you to keep their promises and at a certain point you will realize that most promises don't take promises seriously. That is where the tendency comes to promise things to yourself but have no serious obligation in your head. That is where the first steps to lying to yourself starts. From there onwards anytime you promise yourself that you would stop doing a bad behavior or that you would start doing a good behavior, it will be hard for you to keep the promise. Because you have seen others dismiss promises and consider them as simple statements, and you have seen how you would promise things to others and not follow through with it. Slowly just like that you start lying to yourself.
It's crucial that you do not follow this pattern. The first step to surviving in this world is to have yourself on your side and for that you need to foster a trusting relationship with yourself. So keep in mind when you make promises to yourself, only make the promises that you know you wholeheartedly can do and if you do make a promise, follow through with it to the end.   
Aside from that, carving out a path for yourself requires a lot I will say that for sure. Right now I am at a place where I need to stand strong on my idea and push forward with it while taking in the feedback of others in a healthy manner. It's rough I must say, but it is necessary for us to be able to form an opinion of our own. It can be a struggle to find a solid foundation to rely on but do not let that discourage you. As long as you learn how to put your effort in at the right time and to go with the flow the rest of the times, it can be a lot easier to navigate. When is the right time to put in the effort and when is the right time to go with the flow. Well my dear, I wouldn't be able to find that answer for you. Only advice I can give is to listen objectively. Listen to your body objectively, listen to others objectively, listen to your mind objectively. Your body can rarely lie but your mind and those around you can. Ask nicely and your body shall respond.

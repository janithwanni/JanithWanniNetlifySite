Actions speak louder than words    
and he was never taught the word love.    

He did not know that    
he could love himself    
for ever since young    
he was told that    
he was not lovable or useful     
he was disgusting and unapproachable    

But he did know that    
he needed to show his love for others      
so that they would stay    

And so he gave himself the bare minimum      
in food, in shelter, in care,    
and when love and reassurance was needed      
he simply spoke with the loudest actions      
by buying fancy gifts     
by indulging himself of substance    
by reaching the climax     
of either his senses or his accomplishments      

For actions were louder than words    

And he loved others with gifts     
by being their ride or die     
by checking up on them      
by cheering them on       
by dedicating his time, money and energy

But he did not know     
how to say the word love      
to any of them.

The thing with actions     
is that actions are loud.     

And every time words were not said     
the silence had to filled by actions     
that were louder and louder.     
As the hearing slowly fell apart     
words do not cross his ears anymore     
only actions do.        
But the louder his actions get      
the more tired he got     

<i>
You need the softness of words      
to gently tell the truth     
for if you can't speak it     
how do you know     
whether your actions are speaking     
what you want to say     
</i>

    "text": "Day 1: Ponies and Lies\nStraight away, I recognised the woman doting on her children as the bully from my high school. I lowered the rim of my bucket hat hoping she wouldn’t see my face. Two girls were sitting beside her both of them wearing shorts and “My Little Pony” t-shirts. Seeing the logos on their tees brought a visceral memory to the forefront of my mind, where I could see Brittney, my high school bully, munching on her gum while looking over her shoulder at the cover of my diary since I was a little girl.\n“Ew, you are still into those cringey ponies. Grow up bitch. Putting stickers on that stupid book won’t hide the slutty things you are writing there, you fat whore” She scoffs as she walks away with her entourage. At the same time, I stare frozen on the spot noticing everyone’s waves of laughter and wrinkled nose and brow magnified to an overwhelming state. The vision cuts to me in an unknown bathroom with tears in my eyes as I breathe in short gasps after Brittany’s boyfriend Josh tried to grope me jeering “I heard from Brittany that you would be a good slut for anyone”. And the vision settles into me in my bedroom writing into my diary, with tears staining the pages, “Why does everyone call me a slut when I haven’t even held a guy’s hand before?”\nIt has been 20 years since I survived Brittany’s reign during high school. And yet, I still froze on the spot when I saw her, half expecting her to look at me and start cackling at me with her daughters, pointing and laughing at me. I wasn’t sure whether it was the run I just did or the series of visions that made me out of breath. Either way, I had to take a deep breath and rest my palms on my leggings to calm myself down.\n“I think that’s enough running for today,” I say as I tap the end on the smartwatch noticing that the distance was a metre shy of 5 kilometres even though I felt like I ran a lot more. My pace was at a moderate 5 minutes and I knew it needed to be improved a lot more if I was going to secure first place in the annual regional marathon after getting second place three years in a row.\nI tear my eyes away from the scene in front of me. “Mommy, mommy look my shirt is shining” I hear a little girl’s shrill excitement from behind me. I peek behind my shoulder and hear “Aw that’s beautiful sweetie, these ponies were mommy’s favourite friend throughout mommy’s life too, aren’t they beautiful”. I whip my head around to look back at Brittany and her daughters to see her giggling with her daughters sharing their joy of the ponies glinting in the sunlight.\n“I could settle this once and for all. I am an adult now. I do not have fear her any longer” I whisper to myself as my hands curl into fists. I walk up to Brittany and stand in front of her and her daughters blocking the sunlight falling on their faces. For a moment she looked puzzled at me squinting her eyes to look at who was standing in front of her.\n“I’m sorry do I know you from somewhere ’cause you look familiar.” She cocks her head to the side with a bemused look.\n“Glad to see that you are finally owning up to enjoying My little pony, after bullying me for so long. How would you feel if your kids were called fat whores and groped at parties? Did you even think about how much it would affect the people around you?” The words flow from my mouth as if I was possessed by angry spirits that were sealed shut in a tomb for ages.\n“Oh…, Oh dear. You must have confused me for my twin sister. Are you talking about Brittany?” Her face darkens and the corners of her lips draw down in a sign of mild sadness.\n“Oh my god, I’m so sorry. I thought you were Brittany, I’m really sorry” My palm wraps around my mouth as I look at the entire face again in shock. I had recognised parts of her as my high school bully but there are subtle changes in her nose and ears that somewhat pointed to the alternative.\n“That’s all right, it happens all the time. I don’t think you heard the news I suppose? Yeah, you wouldn’t be yelling at a random woman on the streets if you knew I guess. Brittany passed away a few months ago.” She grimaced as the words left her mouth.\nThe palm resting on my mouth clasped tighter as I took in a deep breath. “Oh my.. what happened? I’m so sorry I didn’t know that happened.”\n“It was sudden for us too. She had eloped with this drug dealer a few years ago. The only time we heard anything about her was when her body was found in a gang war site where two rival cartels had a shootout. It was shocking for us too.” She said with a solemn grace and looked down.\nThe story seemed outlandish but as I pieced together Brittany’s dating history, it all seemed to make more sense. “I’m absolutely stunned to hear that. I’m really sorry again for the confusion” I say as I select my words with caution. It was hard going through what Brittany did to me. At the same time, she did not deserve to die in such a tragic way. “I should get going back home. I will drop by later to properly offer my condolences.” I mutter as I turn away from the scene for the second time.\n“That’s all right sweetie, you don’t have to really” She smiled weakly and stared into the distance. I could not muster the energy to reply back so I decided to slowly trudge my way back home.\n“You did good sweeties, both of you didn’t speak while mommy was talking to an adult” I could hear Brittany’s sister cooing to her daughters as I walked by.\n“But mommy your name is Brittany isn’t it?” The youngest daughter asks loudly from the edge of the seat.\n\n\nDay 2: The cycle goes on\nNervously, she opened the door to the abandoned house. The door creaked forward on rusted hinges and the golden light from the evening sun flowed into the house. Standing at the doorway, she saw a narrow passageway that stretched out beyond the safety of the light and two large doors on either side of the entrance. Taking a deep breath of the mouldy stale air she patted around in the dark around the edge of the doorframe to find a tiny switch. Flicking it on did nothing however as the passageway was still only illuminated by the sun behind her. She sighed with an audible “Oh dear” and fumbled around in her purse to find her mobile. Flipping open the tattered leather case she presses on the small button on the side, the center and the two buttons that are connected together. But the screen remained pitch black. “Must be something wrong with these phones.” she grumbles as she shoves the phone back into the purse. With a shake of her head she steps forward, and closes the door behind her. The darkness engulfed her with only a strip of light visible far away at the bottom of the passageway. She could not see clearly from where it was coming from and with heavy steps of foot and wood, she limped forward with her cane to the source of the light.\nThe light was spilling from under a door on the side of the passageway. From behind the door faint music was being played and she could a voice having a rushed conversation in a language she didn’t understand. She reached for the door knob and twisted it to realise the door was locked. As soon as she twisted the door knob the conversation stopped and the music faded away. “He doesn’t want to be disturbed I guess” she thinks to herself “Must be busy with studies and catching up with his family back home”. After a while the music and the conversation flowed again and so she turned around to walk back to the front of the passageway where she knew the living room would be at.\nFrom the tiny slivers of light creeping into the room from the blinds on the windows she could make out the outline of the couch she usually falls asleep in. Slowly after lowering herself on to the couch she puts her cane away and grabs a blanket from the nearby chair as she gently lays down on the sofa with the blanket wrapped around her. A slight cough crawls in through her throat and one after another several long drawn out coughs kept piling in. With each cough she could feel her heartbeat waver and settle, and once her breath settles she gently closes her eyes to fall asleep.\nWhen she opened her eyes again she was at the doorway to this house. Nervously, she opened the door to the abandoned house. The door creaked forward on its hinges and the golden light from the evening sun flowed into the passageway. Stepping into the house she closed the door behind her as usual knowing that none of her light sources were there and that she would have to rely on her memory of the place. Looking around she could see that the sliver of light at the bottom of the passageway has opened up. The light from inside the room has spilled onto the passageway illuminating the entire house with a tiny soft glow. “Wonder what he must be up to” she thinks to herself as she steps forward to the light. At that moment the door to her left opens up and a boy in her mid twenties steps out and walks past her. He did not acknowledge her presence and simply walked forward towards the light. “Must be busy as always working on his studies” she smiles and walks over to the couch in the living room to her right. She lies down on the couch keeping the cane to the side.\nAs the line of coughs began to creep in she could hear from afar the boy talking loudly. “Gosh mom you wouldn’t believe how bad this house is, even after grandma passed away I can still smell her horrible old smell around the house. Like right now even I smelled it near the doorway. I don’t know how long I can keep staying at this hell hole with doors being opened randomly and broken switches being flipped on randomly.”\nWhen she opened her eyes again she was at the doorway to this house. Nervously, she opened the door to the abandoned house.\n\n\nDay 3: Love and Fate\nYou never know who you’ll bump into at a funeral. The words of my best friend were stuck in my head as I looked at the scenery of the countryside passing behind me. There is no possible reality where this funeral would be eventful. It was saddening to hear that Grandma passed away unexpectedly when she was getting excited to celebrate her birthday next month. I was at my workplace near dozing off when I received the phone call from my mom about the news. Since then it has been a whirlwind of packing and planning flights to arrive at my hometown. I was excited to sleep in my childhood bed after a long time but I was not enthusiastic at all about meeting my high school friends and close family. The houses started looming ahead of me as I realized how close I was to my destination. With a deep sigh I braced myself to the barrage of questions and supposed familiar faces I had to greet and recognize.\n“It is quite sad to hear that she passed away, we were all excited with her to celebrate her 90th birthday party.” A man who’s face I could not recognize shook my hand while looking at me expectantly with solemn eyes. It was almost as if he was looking for a sign on my face showing how I too was excited about her birthday. “Yes it was hard to hear for us all as well. But I’m sure wherever she is, she would be still excited for everything the world has to offer”. I smiled as the words flowed through my mouth as if I had practiced these eulogies beforehand. Truth be told, I did. I knew that everyone wanted to size me up and make me feel bad for moving out into the city after high school leaving behind most of my friends and family. They wanted to know if I still had an inkling of humanity and compassion left after moving to the big city. Truth be told, I did.\nThe man smiled widely bordering on ingenuity and moved along to talk with couple other colleagues he saw near the bar. My grandma always being the one to make things interesting had specifically requested alcohol to be served at her funeral in her will. As I scanned the bar area, I think my grandma knew what would soothe our family more than I would have been able to.\n“Yoo, it’s been a long time man, Justin right?” A deep voice came from the right side of me and I turned to come face to face with a tall muscular man who was offering his hand as an invitation for the ‘bro hug’ as they call it. ” We were in the same class in high school, you remember right? I was the one trying to get that girl in our class from bullying you that one time. What was her name” He laughed and patted my back as we disengaged from the hug. For a solid second I was lost in a sea of memories.\nFirst came an image of a young girl with long black hair and deep brown eyes that would take anyone’s breath away, at least it did for me. Lizzie was her name and the frown on her brow and the wrinkles on her nose indicated to only the disgust and loathing that she felt when she saw me. The reason for those emotions, I have never known, but I could only assume they were because I looked not that attractive and somehow I managed to be put in to the same class as her all through out highschool. Every year, friends would shuffle around between classes but for some god’s entertainment I was kept in the same class as her every year. She would always be getting first place in her studies while I would be at the second place no matter how hard I tried. ‘Fugly Justin always ending up burnt by Lizzie’s sizzle’ was the term that was spread around high school and she made sure that her sizzle would include a barrage of scoffs induced descriptions of my looks and my nerdy nature.\n“Yeah I remember you clearly bro.” I clearly did not. “Thanks to you it was a lot easier going through the last year with Lizzie going a bit extra for some reason on the bullying” I smile back politely pulling myself out of the memory lane that I was trapped in. “Haven’t seen for a while now, hope she’s doing okay”. I mumble with a smile as a contribution to the conversation.\n“Well yeah she went through some tough times with her divorce after the jerk of her husband cheated on her. We haven’t seen her in ages and I doubt she would be here either” The man who’s name I should know looked around as if he was hoping to find her among the crowd. “Anyways smell ya later bro. You have become hella ripped since you left high school man, you should tell me your workout routine someday. Fugly Justin looks like should be now called Fuck boy Justin haha” he walked away laughing at his own twist to the joke.\n“I sure hope not to find her here today. I don’t think I can handle interacting with her today.” I sigh and relax my shoulders from the tension I had endured.\n“Justin? Is that you?” The familiar female voice seemed like an echo from the memories that I witnessed. I whip my full body to the side to come face to face with the same deep brown eyes that I fell in love with all through out highschool. “Lizzie?” I croaked.\n\n\nDay 4: Two masks\nShe was beginning to realise how far down in her memory she’d buried her teenage years. It has been years since I last saw Justin and for a split second she couldn’t recognize him until she overheard his name being mentioned by the man in front of him.\n“Coming to this funeral was a mistake.” She sighed deeply and tried to relax her shoulders. After leaving high school she has tried her best to forget the horrible person she was during high school and find ways to forgive herself and move past it. But seeing the most consistent victim of her unstable teenage brain standing here made her feel sick in her stomach. Every time the memories of her teenage years comes up in her mind she would wince in pain and try to shove the thought carrying the memory away with every will power that she has. She knew that in reality confronting these thoughts and making peace with them is what needs to be done. What better place to start than the one person she annoyed consistently through out the years. The one person she started having feelings for because of his core values, despite him not fitting in with the stereotypical teenage boy.\nMustering up all the courage she had, she stepped closer to Justin after the other man had left, making sure he wouldn’t see her approaching him. “Justin? Is that you?” she whispered the name that had haunted her dreams ever since leaving high school. Justin spun around and looked at her with such intensity that she had to take a step back.\n“Lizzie?” he said in a barely audible voice with a look of fear and horror written all over his face. “Hi uhh, I didn’t expect you to be here. Not that I don’t want you to be here. I do want you here. Not that I was planning on seeing you here. It’s nice seeing you here. Not that it’s nice only because you are here. Uhhh…” He rambled on in a flurry of words that Lizzie could not even keep track of.\n“Did he say that he wanted to see me? That can not be. Who in their right mind would want to see the one person that made their life a living hell for three years?” As the thoughts whizzed past Lizzie’s head, she pulled a mask of decency and composure and spoke calmly “Yeah it’s me Lizzie, it’s nice seeing you back again Justin. How was the time spent in the city after leaving high school?”. Even though the voice leaving her mouth was calm and composed, deep inside she was struggling to keep back from yelling how sorry she was for all the hell she let loose on him.\n“Oh yeah the city life was a bit hectic but I’m getting used to it now. What about you? How have you been doing since leaving high school? I didn’t hear much about you either.” His face instantly became composed the same way that she did and the words flowing through him were calm. It was the same technique that she used when she was feeling overwhelmed, she noticed that immediately.\n“It’s been all right. Been working in on some project management work and it’s been smooth sailing. I didn’t get around to meeting other people for a while because I was busy setting up my career.” Lies. All lies. She knew perfectly well that she couldn’t meet up with anyone because there was no one to meet up with that would forgive her behavior. The only friends she had were deep into some messy business with their boyfriends getting into drug dealing businesses. But after working in the corporate world she learned the right way to talk to people without showing her cards.\nHe took a deep breath and sighed before saying “I don’t know if this is the right place to say this but would you be interested in having a cup of coffee tomorrow. I was planning on running in the morning and I would love to catch up with you tomorrow after that”. He smiled faintly and for a moment Lizzie wanted to scream out yes and hug him tight the same way she day dreamed of when she was in high school.\n“Yeah my calendar should be free tomorrow.” There was no calendar to check up on. “I am also taking up running these days and can join with you for the run tomorrow.” she had never physically run a mile in real life, aside from running away from the memories of her teenage years. The only form of physical exercise she had was the yoga that she did at home while watching a Youtube video.\n“Oh wow that would be great” There was a small crack in his composure as a sliver of genuine excitement came to his face. Lizzie was not sure if it was real or if her mind was drawing illusions on his face. “I will be starting off from the church and it will be an easy 5K run around the running pathway.”\nShe smiled widely to hide the panic of running 5 kilometers for the first time with no prior training. “Great I will see you then”.\n\n\nDay 5: Pride run\nIn the middle of a crowd, he felt a tap on his shoulder. He turned back to see the familiar face he was expecting to see near the church when he arrived for his morning run.\n“Heyy, sorry about the delay. Got a bit late getting ready for the run today.” she smiled as she looked at him intently. His eyes quickly darted to check her attire and rested on her eyes once again. She was wearing a gray pushup bra with tight leggings and her black hair was tied up in a ponytail behind her. For all his time in high school he had never seen her in this attire and he was thankful that he didn’t get to see it during high school. Otherwise he would have fallen harder for her and it would have been even more difficult for him to let go of this place and move to the city to continue his studies.\n“That’s all right. There’s no fixed time to start running so we can start anytime we want. Shall we start with the warmup then?” he asked as he moved to the side of the track lifting his knee to his abdomen.\n“Yeah for sure, warmup is crucial yes.” he heard her whisper in a soft tone as she mirrored his stance in front of him. Her face did not speak of any emotion and she stared on to the distance as she followed the warmup routine that he was doing.\n“Lovely weather for a run today. And it’s a lot more spacious here than the city.”\n“Yeah I would assume so”\n“The leaves are turning golden slowly, ready for the fall season it seems”\n“It looks that way, yes”\n“I will miss these when I have to leave back to the city in another three days time.”\n“WHAT??”\nHe was taken aback by her abrupt and loud response. “Yeah why not, I could get leave only for a few days since it was my grand mother’s funeral. Have to get back to work again after settling the family matters.” He shook his head as if to dust away the clouds of worry that gathered at the horizon every time he though of having to go back.\n“Oh… yeah that makes perfect sense. You would need to get back to your workplace to do…” She frowned and looked at him straightening herself from the hamstring stretch. “Forgive me if I’m being rude, what exactly is it that you are doing in your job? We all knew you went to the city to study something related to fashion I think”\n“Well yes it was to study fashion and right now I’m the lead designer in a team working on women’s sport wear, these days we are working on a project to make comfortable and breathable running tops.” He smiled while making sure to look directly at her eyes. He wanted to know badly what she thought of his position. For a split second (or did he imagine it?) she furrowed her brow and a slight pout formed on her lips. But within the next moment her face was back to the usual composed blank slate that she held for so long. It was almost like she didn’t want to show her true emotions.\n“That’s great to hear. I’m sure you must be doing pretty amazing work at your job.” She said with a smile. “Perhaps someday I can try out the sports wear that you made for my running sessions”. She looked far away into the distance as if she was picturing that moment.\n“Well if you do want I think I have one sample that I wanted to see if the final material fit well to the specifications we gave. I mean if you are comfortable with doing that. I can pay you the same rate we pay our models if you want.” He said quickly and looked down in embarrassment.\n“No thank you. I’m not some bimbo for you to try clothes and ogle at.” She said sternly with squinted eyes. “Shall we get to this run of yours?” She said stepping on to the track.\n“Yes yes we shall” He said with a sigh and began running with Lizzie following along.\nA few minutes passed and his watch indicated that he had reached 2.5 kilometers in his run. He looked back to see how Lizzie was doing but she was nowhere to be seen for a long distance. He quickly ran back along the track looking for her and after running for another 10 minutes or so he found her on the side of the track holding on to the trunk of a tree.\n“Hey are you all right” As he ran closer he could see that she had thrown up on the side of the road and was holding on to the tree panting heavily.\n“Yeah I’m all right, you continue on the run, I will join you someday later. I think I will be heading home after cleaning myself up and the mess I made here. Thanks for the invite to the coffee but I will have to get a rain check on that.” She said without looking up at him in the most calm composed tone she could muster.\n“That’s fine I can stay and help out. The coffee wasn’t a big deal.”\n“I think I made myself clear that I want to head home by myself. I would prefer it if you didn’t cross that boundary right now.”\n“Yes yes of course I understand. Sorry about all this Lizzie, hope you feel better soon.” His flurry of apologies triggers him back to his old memories where he apologized for his appearance to Lizzie when she mocked him infront of others. “I will be needing some time alone by myself after the run as well. See you around, it was nice catching up with you.”\n“I didn’t ask what you were doing after the run. Take all the time you need and leave back to the city once you are done with your stay here. It was nice catching up with what you were doing back in the city” She said with a grim tone and kicked the dirt around to cover her mess while heading to the water fountain to clean herself up.\n\n\nDay 6:\nWith sadness, she realised they needed some time apart. She came to this realization as she opened the door to her home. After the embarassing scene back near the running track where she nearly threw up her insides, she decided it was best to call it at that point and come home. The obvious truth was that she has never run properly in her life and as she tried to keep up with Justin’s running speed her heartbeat climbed up faster than she could and the longer she tried to push her body forward, the more her body resisted and screamed in protest.\nAdding on to the embarassment was the feeling that was going inside her. She was sure what the feeling was but she could not come to terms with how childish she was. The feeling of jealousy that Justin is surrounded with models wanting to try the clothes that he had made. How childish and stupid was she thinking. Only a boy would think this way she thought to herself as she took stepped into the washroom to clean herself after the run.\nAfter cleaning herself up she fished out her pre made breakfast of yoghurt and oats with berries to start off her work day. She couldn’t shake off how childish and especially immature her mind was earlier. Her distracted mind drove her to open up her socials in between meetings, reenforcing a habit that she wanted to get rid of. After numbing her brain with endless amount of teenagers dancing and cats falling backward as a slice of cheese fell on their head, she was about to get back into her work when she noticed a new message request had popped up on her notifications. She was sure it was some random dude with a big burly moustache or a profile picture of an anime character saying ‘Hi’. The day was ruined by this point so I might as well indulge myself with the newest challenger to the ring, she thought as she clicked the notification and her eyes grew large as she read the name that had messaged her.\nJustin Stewart: Hey, I hope you are doing all right after the run this morning. I’m really sorry … The rest of the message was cut off with the limited preview space but her curiosity was already drawing out possible replies. Checking the time she realised there’s more than 4 hours to go in her workday. Also she didn’t want to appear too eager even though technically Justin wouldn’t be getting a read receipt until she replies back.\nAfter trudging through 4 hours of mind numbing she finally was able to sign off from work as she ceremoniously closed the laptop off. Moving from one screen to another, she quickly opened up her phone to check the apology from Justin. For a split second, she froze as she caught herself feeling the surge of emotions she felt back during high school watching Justin take in her mocking, only this time there was no crowd to witness and watch in awe at her prowess. “Damn it, this mindfulness shit from therapy is starting to work now” She cursed as she took a deep breath and detached herself from the past memory.\n“I’m not in high school anymore where I need to win everyone’s approval to stay valuable.”\n“I’m not in my childhood home where my dad wanted a son so being rough and mean was the only way to win his affection”\n“I’m not my past self. I’m guilty but I will not bully myself for the mistakes I have done”\nShe muttered the phrases that her therapist had recommended while breathing deeply. When she first started therapy, her therapist told her to say these out loud even if she didn’t feel like it, and now she’s slowly starting to realize its effectiveness.\nAfter making sure her head was in the right place she opened the message to view Justin’s message.\nJustin Stewart: Hey, I hope you are doing all right after the run this morning. I’m really sorry if I said anything hurtful to you, because you seemed pretty upset when you told me to go back to the city. I was wondering whether you would be free to have some food at the Italian restaurant near my house. It’s on me, consider it a token of apology for whatever I did wrong to you. Also it seems that I will have to return back to the city sooner than I thought because it seems my wife has fallen sick and I will have to go see her soon.\nHer heart fell as the she read the last line. Not because she cared for the wellbeing of Justin’s wife but the mere existence of a wife caught her by surprise. It shouldn’t be a surprise shouldn’t it? Everyone deserves love. Long lasting committed love. Unlike her recent divorce with her cheating husband.\n\n\nDay 7: The fallen gryphon\nNo one had been down the overgrown path for years, yet the indents on the ground in front of him are undeniable. The path has overgrown to this state not because of an unspeakable murder or horrific incidents as the rumours in the town would tell, but rather simply due to neglect. He knew the previous owners of the house and when he asked whether there was a special reason the pathway was not being used to they chuckled and said “oh we can’t be bothered cleaning that area up. We have better things to do inside the house itself. Besides it also creates a nice set of rumours that keeps trespassers away”\nThe indent on the ground infront of him did not seem human life nor did it look like it belonged to any animal that he had seen before. The closest resembling footprint would have been that of a wolf but there were also large three pronged foot prints mixed in between that did not simply make sense. It was as if a wolf and a chicken decided to take a stroll together down the path reminiscning on the good old times.\nThe other issue staring directly at his face was the fact that the bushes along the path have been cleared through as well. Meaning that whatever that decided to walk through this path had also crossed into the forest that is part of the land owned by the previous owners.\nUsually this should not bother him, but at this instance he knew he had to investigate where the footsteps ended to atleast to clear the air out on whether this was a prank or not. Walking down the pathway, he made sure not. to step on the footprints that were already clear on the muddy ground. Occasionally he would come across clumps of feathers that were caught up in the branches along the side of the path.\nThe footprints took him to an open area where the ground was trampled on clearly by something with a heavy weight. A tree has fallen in the side of this clearing and the log had been moved to the side. This has crossed the border of being a prank pulled by the neighborhood teenagers by the time he had fully assessed the clearing.\nThe footprints do not progress further from that clearing, as the road ahead was full of gravel and therefore no sign of any mud could be seen. However he could see a set of golden feathers being strewn across the gravel path ultimately leading down to the caverns in the heart of the forest. These caverns were mainly inhabited after the owners moved in but based on whatever happened here it seems there’s more to it than what meets the eye. He stepped through the crunching gravel pathway noticing how some of the gravel had been scattered as if heavy steps were being taken. Stepping down into the caverns he went and peered inside the first cavern in the system. It was cool dark and warm as all caves have been in his lifetime.\nA soft squelching sound made him look down to realize that he was about to step on what seemed to look like vomit. He was surprised he didn’t get the scent of it from afar but as he stepped over the supposed throw up he started to question what exactly could have been the series of events that led to this.\nA soft groan peaked his ears and he spun to his left to see where the noise was coming from."

    "text": "To my dear muse,\nEven a glance at your divine eyes, a glimpse of your smile, and a swish of your hair as you race past me, makes my heart skip a beat.\nI would not have been able to go forward as all of my focus would have been lost on your beauty.\nI am but a humble fool, an instrument of the gods put in this world to describe the most grandiose personification of beauty that the heavens have placed on this earth.\nLike the breeze carrying the scent of spring and bringing memories to all, unknowingly to you, my dear muse, memories and reminders of you are always ever so present in every breath I take.\nOh, what a cruel punishment for a humble fool as I am, to be forever captivated in the presence of such beauty, only to be forever unnoticed in the eyes of divine beauty.\nThe sweet melody of your laughter will always bring the warmth of a fireplace in the coldest winters.\nBless my poor heart, my dear muse, I am simply in love with you and you will never know how my eyes see your beauty.\n\n\nTo the smile that touched my heart,\nBe gentle with my frail naive heart. The wings of butterflies are gentle as it is. There is a small light left inside my fractured heart and it burns as brightly as it can. It will give you all the warmth you need on your coldest nights and a bright campfire on a summer night. That is all I can give. In turn, I only ask you to be gentle with my crumbling heart. My mind wanders in worlds that I built and I don’t know if I want them to be true. I write tales of rose colour, only the grim dark reality of life to pull the rug under my feet. I imagine walking beside you and observing your laughter, seeing your eyes squint with joy, and hearing the tone of your voice change as you share your deepest fears and sorrows. Oh how much I wish it to be true, even though the reality is looming behind me to remind me of how all of this will go. So be gentle with my heart but never lose the smile that you have. For every time you smile, the world becomes a bit more colourful.\nOh, how the heart woes for which might never be attainable. That which cannot be attainable can still be achieved. How fickle and naive my heart is. I have no strength to have someone to be close to me,. Yet my heart skips a beat even at the sight and thought of her. Why oh why does my heart run wild with such innocence. What is that my child-like heart speaks of? Someone interesting, someone caring and someone beautiful, and she is all of that.\n\n\nTo the child within me,\nMy little boy,\nI see your heart leap in joy at the sight of her,\nI see the smile that blossoms on the corners of your cheeks unknown to you,\nTake care my little one\nFor I know how much you will care for her,\nFor I know how your world revolves around her,\nBut alas my boy,\nWhen the storm ends,\nand the promised rainbow is nowhere to be seen,\nWill she still be the same?\nWill you still be the same?\nand will she accept your offering?"

The red eyes gazed upon him, and there was no chance of reading any emotion from that darkness within the hood. He pointed the staff up at the hooded figure, and took one deep breath, before whispering loud enough for the figure infront of him to hear. “You took away the family I was born to, but I won’t let you take away the family that I’m a prisoner of”. For a second the glow of the red eyes dimmed as he raised his staff once more and brought it down on a sideway arc on to the shoulder of the figure. With swift reflexes, wood and steel met each other in a dull thud followed by a screeching scrape as the two opponents disengaged.

    "section": "Chapter 1",
    "text": "Chapter 1\n“Harder, Adam, Harder!” That was all that he heard as he began punching left and right to the cotton dummy in front of him. The sensation of fist colliding with cotton registered in his head, but his mind was scattered as his blows slowed to a stop.\n“Adam, if you believe I am going to let you go in such a state as a warrior monk, you are fooling yourself. Do you want me to demote you to where you started from and make you practice breathing in and out again.” The words demoting fell on to his ears and within a split second he became aware of his situation.\nThe cold wind from the open doorway of the training ground brushed against his light robes. But the heat from his arms and his sudden realisation of the possibility of him being demoted ignited a warmth within him. His eyes followed the direction of the commanding yet steadfast voice and met with the unwavering glance of the chief monk, Zalko who was residing over his training at the temple of Leung Kai. He heaved himself up from his slacking stance and looked straight back at the cotton dummy in front of him. And as he let his mind settle into a state of flow, the cotton dummy brought back all the memories that he had kept inside within him. -He found the temple along his journey to strengthen himself after he lost his parents.- From his first day as an initiative of the temple, he had long stood in the middle of the training ground and practiced his breathing all the while staring at this same cotton dummy.\nNow the dummy is beckoning him to prove himself after years of practicing his breathing. He took his opening stance and immersed himself in the reason behind his training. The core memory where his mind was in complete clarity.\nlet’s make a present and past mixing kinda thing. Adam will do a certain action and that will trigger a certain key sensory input from his past which will ease in the reader as to what has happened to him to end up here. And we will end it with Adam delivering the final fatal blow to the dummy and in the past key memory he remembers the person who did that and the sound of his parents falling down. MAKE THE PAST SEGMENTS IN ITALIC IN THE FINAL BOOK\nIt was in the rivers of his village as he lied down to rest on the riverbed, moments before his village was raided.\nAdam took his first step forward from his stance.\n\nFirst it was a soft thud that he heard when the branches of the yew tree above him rustled as if an animal jumped on to it.\n\nHis eyes narrowed down on the cotton dummy covered in brown leather right in front of him.\n\nThen it was two more thuds as he watched three dark brown figures jump their way towards his village.\n\nHis breath quickened as he advanced quickly on the dummy.\n\nHe was panting as he was running towards his village to alert the chief about these creatures.\n\nWith a soft exhale he swiftly delivered his first blow across the ribs of the dummy.\n\nHe watched as the first sentry of his village topple down from his sentry post. And yet no one except him noticed his choked scream muffled with the sound of his crashing bones.\n\nHe took one long breath and delivered seven more blows to the key points of the dummy.\n\nOne by one they fell and all that was left to protect the village was the chief.\n\nAfter the seven blows his breathing slowed, to concentrate on the heart of the dummy. With a graceful fist he delivered his final blow to the heart of the dummy.\n\nAnd that too was gone, with the dull thud of the chief’s body collapsing forward with a blade protruding from his back. And in his place stood three cloaked figures.\n\nHis gaze met with the hollow eyes of the dummy. Black, depthless and unforgiving.\n\nThe cold steel of the double bladed scythe glinted in the horrified villagers eyes. But the shadow of his parents blocked the gleam of fear from entering their eyes as they stood as the last shield for the village.\n\nHe took one last breath, and brought in all the pain and anger he had.\n\nThe double bladed scythe shone in the moonlight and changed colors from silver to crimson as the two bodies crumpled to the ground.\n\nYears of training in mastering his pain and anger, and he finally let go of his emotions. All that he had bottled up inside swam through him and he became one with his ambition. With one last battle cry he delivered a fatal punch to the dummy’s head. Just as his parents fell dead to the scythe of one of the three thieves that raided their villages, the dummy’s head fell clean off from its body and rolled over towards Zalko’s feet.\nThe sound of the broken head rolling was deafening in the silent practicing ground, but for Adam the only sound he could hear was the sound of his heavy breathing. He gathered his thoughts, by pushing them down towards the back of his head, as he always did. His gaze quickly went towards Zalko, to confirm whether his final display of strength was able to convince his master. On the other end of the practicing ground Zalko was staring at the broken head near his feet and didn’t move for a long time.\n“Well? Did I pass the test?” Adam finally asks with no regards for the traditional respect that entails the end of a test in the temple of Liung Kai. Zalko slowly raises his head to look deeply at Adam. It was then only that Adam gained awareness of where he was and what he was doing at that moment. He brought his palms together and bowed and whispered “Master, I have completed my training, have I mastered the ancient ways of Liung Kai, the first of his kind.” It was a phrase that he had memorised for a long time everyday when he envisioned himself becoming a true warrior monk of this temple.\n“You have completed your training young initiative, come with me and take your birth right as a new warrior monk of the temple of Liung Kai”. Zalko whispered softly with his gaze fixated on him, but his eyes seemed quite distant at the same time, as if he was lost in thought. Zalko turned around and began walking towards the main shrine of the temple. Adam let out a sigh of relief, but his face never showed a smile. He adjusted his robe and slowly walked behind Zalko.\nThe main shrine was a few feet away from the training grounds and was the main area where monks held their rituals. As he was walking towards the main shrine, his gaze met with the peach trees that lined the pathway and his thoughts went back to where he started from. Adam had entered this temple through the words of his previous master, the village Swordskeeper. The swordskeeper was like a father to him as he taught him all that he knew about swordsmanship. He also had learnt from the temple of Liung Kai, but he couldn’t make it to the end and become a warrior monk. He had guided him and prepared him for what would he have to face inside the temple, but even he couldn’t prepare him for what was about to happen next.\nHis train of thoughts was disturbed by the creaking noise of wood grating against iron, as Zalko opened the door of the main shrine before him. The first sense that overwhelmed him was the smell of stale air that had been kept locked for ages. “Hasn’t anyone become a warrior monk in a long time?” Adam asked while trying his best to breath slowly. “It has been ages since a warrior monk has proven his skills in this temple. Mostly because no one ever persevered long enough to take up the final task. The ways of Liung Kai is different from other temples, as our great ancestor himself believed that students of this temple should rigorously follow the fundamentals of breathing and staying calm in the most stressful situations.” Zalko said calmly as he walked around opening the windows of the shrine to let in the cool November air in. Adam took in all that was around him and realised that he was standing in the midst of a room full of statues and weapons mounted on the walls. From clubs to hammers to whips and staffs and finally ending in broad swords and long swords, the entire wall of the shrine was a monument to all the fighting styles taught in the temple of Liung Kai.\n“Traditionally, a warrior monk of the Liung Kai receives double short swords as his parting weapon from the temple.” Adam suddenly realised that Zalko had been talking to him all through out the time that he was staring at the weapons. “Yes master” Adam whispered in a calm tone bowing down to show his respect. He was eager to receive the double short swords as his parting gift and continue on his true journey. His face showed no excitement as he knew what his true aims were. “However, it can also be the case that the master of an initiative can decide whether to give him a different weapon as a lesson for him to grow.” Zalko said gravely as he stared down at Adam from the other end of the shrine.\nAdam stared back at Zalko’s eyes, trying his best to keep his shock away from his face. It was a skill that he had to learn the hard way from the day his parents passed away, where everyone was trying their best to coax him out of going after the thieves. “Never let your face tell your true mission to anyone” Those were the words that the Swordskeeper of the village told him, whenever he showed anger at the mention of great raid.\n“As you wish master, I shall gladly accept your words of wisdom.” Adam said once again bowing slightly. “Adam, heed my words, and I need you to do more than just accept them. Do not try to douse a burning house by embracing it with your whole self. In the end the house will always perish, but if you firmly hold on to your embrace on the burning house, you shall also join the ashes of the burnt house.” Zalko whispered softly to Adam, and for a moment Adam could see a slight hint of worry in his brow. Adam nodded deeply and said “I understand master, my teachings from this temple will help me a lot in dousing the flames of the burning house” Adam whispered in a reassuring tone. Zalko’s brow furrowed even more at his reply and in a flash of a second all traces of worry vanished from his face, replaced by a simple empty expression. With a soft nod he walked towards the farthest end of the shrine to pick up a long object from the wall. “You are still far away from understanding the true nature of your own self. I believe the lesson that you have to learn, will be completed through the help of this weapon.” Zalko brought forward to him a wooden staff that was as tall as he was. Adam could not hide the shock anymore as he let his mouth gape open at the sight of the wooden staff presented to him. “This is Pasindir, it’s a wooden staff with heavy metal weights on either ends. As you can see there are three rings on each end, and each ring has heavier metal towards the end.” Zalko let the staff roll off his hands and Adam caught it a moment before it hit the ground. As he straightened up, Adam was able to hide the shock that was in his mind. His jaw was clenched in anger, and his fists gripped the staff tightly as if he was trying to break it into two, just to show Zalko that a mere toothpick can not help him in his mission. He had wasted months on training in the hopes of getting the coveted short swords, and now he had been presented with a simple staff and a lesson to learn out of the temple. He bowed once again deeply, deep enough to show his gratitude in a sarcastic way. “Thank you master, I shall cherish this gift with a lot of gratitude.” Every word that came out of his mouth dripped with sarcastic anger. “Remember my words Adam, warrior monk of Liung Kai, do not burn yourself trying to douse burning houses.” Zalko said softly as he began the preparations for the ceremony."

    "section": "Appendix",
    "text": "Appendix\nThese were written during the Twitch stream as supporting ideas.\nCharacters:\nAdam: * A person with vengeance in mind * Standing for the right thing * Someone who would do his best to prove that he’s right. * He would do whatever it takes to set his will on other people. * thinks he knows whats best for other people. * medium well built, black hair combed to the side, deep xamber eyes, sharp jawline, well shaved and well dressed and well mannered. Default clothing would be, grey leggings, black jacket (when its cold) dark green shirt. The thief clan (Malicious Boys) * There are three thieves in the clan * Jacob, Larry, Bert. * Jacob is the leader, sensible, moral compass is set in a way that he thinks the entire world against him and that he has to do whatever it takes to stand by himself. He cares the world about his clan * Larry is just a side kick who just adores Jacob. * Bert who has a really bad desire for bloodlust. Bert is the person who killed Adam’s parents.\nCity (Anorak)\n* Its in the middle of a valley. The border is roughly circular. There are only two gates. One is from the south another from the north. To the west and the east are two mountains. The mountains are taken up by the rich and wealthy (Panjures). They have built massive castles and their entire estates upon them. And towards the middle , The poor peasants take up their space in the deepest point of the valley. The peasants make their livelihood by farming, and other businesses. Their products are sent towards the mountainside for the Panjures to use. There’s a clear visible divide between the rich and the poor. And the rich ignite fires of doubt between the poor people to make sure that they are safe. There is a main river that divides the city into two halves (Left wing and right wing). Internally there is a feud between the left wing and the right wing. \n* Legislation and the law enforcement. There is a common place to make laws and discuss policies called the Atrium, where skilled lawyers and debaters from the left and right wings take part in pushing forward their ideas. It is headed by the Governor who decides on the final decision. The Governor is a position thats been handed down generation to generation and they have been impartial since the start. Law enforcement happens in two ways, the left and right wings have their own secret services, the governor has a secret service (the spiders), and a military (the nighthawks)  and a local guard (the bulldogs). The local guard is divided within where the left and right wings influence the arrests made by the local guard and whether they are sent to the Atrium to be judged. \n* /TODO: RELIGION/\n* The division among peasants. Left and right wing supporting clans and then the the middle wing clans (they are there for the peasants). \n* /TODO: How many clans are there? What are their specialities? weapons or cultural or based on religion? What do they do? How do they affect the lives of the peasants? How about left wing supporting clans steal from right wing panjures and the right wing supporting clans steal from left wing panjures. And the middle wings steal from both panjures and thieves alike./ \nPlot Structure:\nAdam is training to be a warrior monk. He had lost his parents and his brother in a raid that happened on his village. The raid happened on his birthday by a group of thieves who simply destroyed the village and stole everything, but they didn’t use force. They simply assassinated the chief of the village and took down all the guards, and basically asked everyone to bring in everything they had, and Adam’s parents resisted. And one of the thieves simply struck both of them infront of Adam, despite the protests and warnings of the other members of the thief clan. Soon after they have realized what they have done, they fled the scene with the gold.\nAdam trains his way to become a master and then hunts down the MB, and then finds Bert drinking with all the gold that he stole, and Adam straight up just finishes him in a subtle manner. After that Adam, encounters the rest of the MBs, and they simple overpower him. And then they have a talk together.\nApparently, Jacob and Larry also have suffered the same tragedy that Adam has suffered where they also lived in a village a bit far away from the city. Their villages were raided at the same time and Jacob and Larry got together while running away from the raids (Mind you the clans that raided their villages were a bit more towards aggressive and gory side), and they ventured out into the city and their story is a thing for another time. But they began the MB while being socially respected and more recognized as gentleman with great status. Bert was later taken up as an apprentice after they found him left for death by another clan.\nThe city is ridden with thieving clans and there is a war going on between the guardians of the city and in between the thieving clans as well.\nWhile Adam is in their custody and after Adam gets to hear their stories, Adam is still kept in their hideout while Jacob and Larry venture out to gather as much as people as possible. And then one night a thief clan decides to attack their hideout. And at that moment Adam is freed to fight alongside them, and there is the place where Adam crosses paths as he’s saved by Jacob and he manages to save Larry as well."

And I pour my heart out to you\nin hopes that you will be my witness\nDespite my yearning,\nI can never be able to get out of this swing,\nand step on to the ground with you.\nFor I know that,\nright now is not the right time,\nand us miles apart is not the right place.\nYet despite all odds,\nI know that,\nus healing together is the right journey,\nfor both of us."

As he continued on going through the letters that were sent to him after his wife’s death, the crimson letter still begged his attention no matter how hard he tried to ignore it. As a soft siren call, the letter was moaning to be opened and release the words held within it. “I’m not ready for you right now, love.” He whispered softly as if the envelope could hear him. He engrossed himself in another letter, one that was more interesting than the rest, which wished him good health in the times of crisis that he was in. All the other letters were one big combination of pity and bitter resent for his unfortunate loss. Only a few addressed his declining mental health after the funeral, and he feared those who did. It was as if they knew the reality and were mocking him instead. How dare they? They didn’t have to do this to him. The scarlet envelope also joined in the mockery with the name “Mrs. Hoffman” glinting in the light above the silver wax seal. Shaking his head, he began writing down a reply to one of the letters he recieved. “Thank you for your condolences, it was quite a shock to me when I heard that my wife, Mrs. Hoffman died from food poisoning. I assure you, I am taking the best care of my mental health since the day of the funeral. I have given my statement to the police as well about who could have murdered my dear beloved wife, but so far the investigation has been inconclusive.” A huge laughter broke his writing, which seemed to have come from the scarlett envelope on his desk. He must have imagined it. Even in her death she knew perfectly well when he was lieing, otherwise how would have she sent this letter to him three days after her funeral."

It was an era where she was free to do what she wanted and get whatever she wanted as many as she wants. She was enjoying her rights without the reponsibilities. It was utter bliss. Now looking back on all those times, as she was sitting on the floor of her one bedroom apartment sipping a cheap bottle of wine as her sole dinner, she couldnt help but feel miserable for all the regrets that she had piled up inside of her. “Yep, that’s the cue for more wine” Her brain automatically jumped into her safety route with her hand searching for the bottle and the glass to pour more wine. “How did it all go wrong for me? Life was so damn amazing for me?” Her mind wandered enough to ask, and just like a tyrant suppressing the media, she quickly washed off that thought with another huge gulp from her glass. “I really should get my life back together.” One more gulp. “This isn’t going to workout for long. I used to be better than this honestly. I need to get back on track with everything that I left behind.” Three huge gulps. It was useless. The wine was a finger in the dam about to be broken apart. All the pent up feeling of regret and bitter resentfulness was piling up threatening to explode and her wine couldn’t keep it back any longer. “I can’t face all of those things right now. I need some time.” she spoke to the empty room with the mattress on the floor. “If not now then when?” Her mind whispered back as her eyes began closing in extreme drowsiness."

The day that she had been waiting for had finally arrived. The day that she get to spend some time with the guy from her art class. He was everything she wanted, and he was giving it consistently with no compromises. Most men promise to give the world to you at once but in reality what women want is the world a drop of the ocean at a time. Consistency is key. Any woman who had to suffer a man going down her in inconsistent rhythms can scream in agreement for that statement. If only men paid more attention to those details in their everyday transactions. It all starts off with a small detail being lost in one day and it snowballs to the entire beauty of it being tarnished by a souless ice cold gesture. Sadly that is how marriages end, in most cases that is. A spark would not be needed if there was no ice cold feelings between a married couple. “Sigh, if only men could understand these things” She sighed to herself as she checked herself in the mirror. Her lips were highlighted with a light shade of pink that complimented her brown skin and her hair was let down in the best possible way that she could manage as it draped over her strapless red evening gown. As she stepped on to her car and drove to the restaurant, her mind was still seething with the absurdity that men could be so dense. For all they could know, the house will slowly start to crumble down into pieces and they slowly sidestep off the rubble and go on their way as if nothing happened. “If the man of the house can’t fix a house then you might as well get a builder to repair the damages.” She scoffed as she slowly arrived at the restaurant. It was when she arrived at the gate of the restaurant that she realized the titans that she had unleashed. Two men were laughing and chatting in loud voices. One of them was her date for tonight, the guy from her art class that gave her the world one drop of the ocean at a time and the other was her husband who gave up giving her the world halfway through."

    "text": "Day 4\nPrompt: They had to make sure that none of their colleagues noticed.\nThe professors and the students were all gathered in one place with soft music, drinks and food for everyone. The entire college hall was brimming with people and a clear separation can be seen between the two crowds as the teaching staff took a corner of the hall and talked all about the good old days and watched the students from afar, while the students took over the entire hall. The dance floor was bustling but his head was not into it not after what happened last night. It was the amazing night of his life and it was the person that he loved the most. The world around him looked bright and colorful after that night with her. And looking at the corner where the teaching staff was gathered, he could see her again from afar laughing and talking with everyone else. The way her laughter made her eyes wrinkle and the musical notes that her laughter creates is heavenly to him. His staring must have been sensed by her as she turned to see him and smiled. There was nothing more that he wanted in this world than to wake up to that smile everyday just like he woke up today. “Yo Mike, what are you doing sitting over there mate? C’mon there’s an entire party going out here.” Joshua shouted from amidst the crowd and he decided to inch his way towards the middle to avoid any suspicion. He acted as if he was dancing when in reality he was just dancing along to get glimpses of her smile. “Dude the fuck do you think you are doing dancing around my girl?” Joshua shouted from afar as he charged against him. “Bro bro it’s a misunderstanding I wasn’t grinding against your girlfriend mate.” Joshua started racing in hands in defeat hoping they would be able to stop the raging bull. “Yeah Joshua I didn’ t even know he was here. Quit yapping about guys grinding against me when you aren’t even here to dance with me” His girlfriend retorted and walked away with the rest of the girls. “Babe no..” Joshua mumbled and glared at Mike as he ran after her. Even through all of this commotion his eyes sought her out and he could see her giggling like a school girl and shaking her head at his embarassment. He couldn’t help but laugh himself. And a moment later his heart sank as she grabbed her bag and headed out towards the door. It was way too early to leave the party now which made him question whether he did something wrong to make her angry. He was now torn between two choices, should he run after her or give her the space she needs. “Screw this” He muttered to himself and ran towards the exit. He needed her. More than anything in the world. Outside he finally caught up to her as she was standing near her car staring out at the stars. She turned as he approached her and smiled to him. “I was wondering when you were going to arrive” She laughed and in an instant his entire world was her laughter. “You could have dropped a text you know?” He said while playing with his hair. “Well I really didn’t want to bring my phone here to steal my time with you.” She whispered and the look in her eyes told him all that he needed. “Get in the car, we are going back to my place.” she winked and jumped in to the car."

She was going through a rough week the past couple of days and she really needed the comfort that she was about to receive. The moment she saw him, it was all over for her. His bushy moustache and his curly hair, took her back to her childhood when she secretly enjoyed the things that were forbidden in her house. His smile beckoned her to come closer to him. At that moment all her problems vanished away and she was the happiest girl in the world. She didn’t care even if she took this to her bed and went down like an animal, succumbing to her carnal pleasures, no matter what otehrs would think of her actions. It was all that she wanted at that moment. To feel fulfilled to the point of whispering “oh my god” and moaning with every moment passing. She was already feeling herself becoming wet as she drooled remembering the mouth watering sensations she had felt. Kentucky Fried Chicken. The huge sign of that old man smiling was all she needed as she remembered how much she wanted to try out their new deal for hot drumlets. Pressing the gas on her vehicle she sped up to the drive through and she ordered all the hot drumlets her heart desired. Just as she imagined just the scent of the chicken made her sigh in relief. She needed a hot drumlet break all along, and she finally got it."

    "text": "Day 6\nPrompt: She had made a poor job of hiding the damage.\nIt was not her best day to begin with even. Her finger was wrapped with a small plaster to stop the bleeding but the kitchen sink was tainted with tiny drops of blood. This wouldn’t have been a hard thing to do if her mother was around to help her out. But it was her decision to move out and start a new life outside her country. “Well I won’t be able to make the mac and cheese anymore at this rate, unless I want to substitute the ketchup with my own blood.” She sighed and began cleaning out the blood stains and gathered the untarnished cheese gratings and poured them to her macaroni to finish cooking the mac and cheese. This was more of a macaroni with a side of cheese rather than a complete mac and cheese like what her mother used to make. After wrapping her food up she managed to get into her sofa and turned on Netflix to eat her dinner while watching some mind numbing tv shows. At that moment she heard the bell of her apartment door ring. Swearing to all the gods out there and the person who decided to ring the bell, she trudged over to the door. Opening the door it was her neighbour, the young man from her home country standing infront of her wearing the cutest shirt that brought out all the curves in his body. “I heard a scream earlier and I wanted to come and check up on you. Are you doing all right?” he said. “Oh no it’s nothing I’m completely fine..” her words were interrupted as his gaze fell on the finger that had been plastered. “Ah so this is what caused it. What were you trying to make? I smell cheese inside here.” He said taking a look around her room which made her sweat intensively considering how messy her room had been the past few days. She could feel all the judgement falling on her and she mumbled “I was making a mac and cheese”. As soon as the words left her mouth his eyes lit up and said “What a coincidence I also made mac and cheese! Do you want to come over to my place and have dinner together? If you don’t mind” He said excitedly and for a moment she wasn’t sure. Was this an invitation to have sex? or was she being genuine. It’s highly unlikely this guy has any feelings for her considering how short and pudgy she looks. She herself didn’t have any feelings for the guy and considered as a friend only. “Yeah sure, I will come over there. Let me put on something better than this.” “Oh no need at all! It’s just a friendly dinner and besides you look really cute in your outfit.” He said with a smile that made her instantly realize “This guy is completely blind and stupid isn’t he? to think that I look cute in my home wear.”"

On his first day as a servant in this grand mansion he never knew what they meant by this well in the garden and he dared not to ask in case people might think he’s not that educated. He searched every nook and corner in the garden but there was not even a sight of a well. The only place where a well could possibly exist was under the oak tree at the centre of the courtyard and unless he topples that tree over he will never know of it. Frankly he didn’t know why he needed to find a well. No one told what was in the well, other than well, water. With no other options he tried his best not to think about the well in the garden, but he couldn’t no matter how hard he tried. And he decided to start from the corner of the garden and inspect one last time. This time he followed any trails of dampness in the soil and soon he realized the trail was taking him in circles around the oak tree or in general the garden. With no other option he had to give up and realize that maybe the well in the garden was right under the tree. But nothing changed now that he knew where the well was upto a certain extent."

    "title": "Riddler Classic : How long will the Bacterial Colony Last",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Excerpt from FiveThirtyEight\nFrom Adam Wagner comes a curious case of colonies:\nYou are studying a new strain of bacteria, Riddlerium classicum (or R. classicum, as the researchers call it). Each R. classicum bacterium will do one of two things: split into two copies of itself or die. There is an 80 percent chance of the former and a 20 percent chance of the latter.\nIf you start with a single R. classicum bacterium, what is the probability that it will lead to an everlasting colony (i.e., the colony will theoretically persist for an infinite amount of time)?\nExtra credit: Suppose that, instead of 80 percent, each bacterium divides with probability p. Now what’s the probability that a single bacterium will lead to an everlasting colony?\n\n\n\n\nLet’s take the case of one bacteria. Looking at the states that a bacteria can achieve it is clear that we can define a Bernoulli random variable as \\[Let\\ X\\ =\\ \\{The\\ event\\ that\\ a\\ bacteria\\ will\\ split\\ into\\ two\\} \\sim Bernoulli(0.8)\\] So first we sample from a Bernoulli variable. And if it comes true then we now have two bacteria.\nNow let’s consider the case of two bacteria where we have two trials. Guess a Bernoulli variable won’t cut it now (pun intended).

Even though I was scared to engage with the community as my initial thought was that I would not be welcome there, I joined my first RLadies meetup with the Plot a lot with ggplot2 workshop done by Priyanga and Thiyanga Talagala. After a few months, I myself received the opportunity to present my knowledge on Data Wrangling in R at the April Meetup of RLadies Colombo.\nThe idea that I wanted to follow in this session was to stray away from the standard workshop format of introducing several functions in a specific package and instead wanted to give a real life scenario where these functions will be used. I had a firm belief that people tend to learn things when they use it in a practical context that means something to them. Hence I used the idea of asking the audience to imagine that they are an intern at Spotify and that they are assigned different tasks that require the specific use of a data wrangling function in the dplyr,tidyr and lubridate packages.\n\n\n@RLadiesColombo just finished another fantastic meetup session.

Data visualization is a skill that most statistics undergraduates obtain in their first year in the university. However, the tools that were used for data visualization in the classroom was limited by their performance and sharing capabilities. Therefore new visualization technologies should be introduced if the students were to take on the task of providing visualizations using modern Business Intelligence tools. To introduce students to these tools along with the Do’s and Dont’s of data visualization, I organized a short webinar on the Fundamentals of Data Visualization.

    "section": "",
    "text": "For this weeks TidyTuesday dataset, the R4DS community has given a dataset on Marble Racing statistics. Specifically one season from Marbula One. Initially I had no idea on the context behind this, and therefore I began exploring a bit by watching the Youtube videos and reading up on the Wiki. My usual procedure for these datasets is to gain an understanding of the context by placing myself in the midst of the context and asking questions along the way.\nRemoving columns from the original dataset\n\nmarbles &lt;- marbles %&gt;% select(-notes,-host,-source)\n\n\n\n\n# Players that have played under different teams --------------------------\n\nmarbles %&gt;% \n  group_by(marble_name) %&gt;% \n  transmute(teams = n_distinct(team_name)) %&gt;% \n  filter(teams &gt; 1)\n\n# A tibble: 0 × 2\n# Groups:   marble_name [0]\n# ℹ 2 variables: marble_name &lt;chr&gt;, teams &lt;int&gt;\n\n# No marbles switched teams\n\nThis was fairly a stupid question that I asked myself before reading the Wiki properly. Regardless, since there was only season it’s highly unlikely that team players will be switching between teams.\n\n\n\n\n# Track Length affects player performance ---------------------------------\n# 32 players in total\n\nmarbles %&gt;% \n  filter(str_detect(marbles$race,\"Q\",negate=TRUE)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(track_length_m = factor(track_length_m)) %&gt;% \n  group_by(track_length_m,marble_name) %&gt;% \n  mutate(row_id = row_number()) %&gt;% \n  ungroup()  %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x=track_length_m,y=time_s))+\n  geom_col(alpha=0.3) +\n  geom_point(size=0.4) + geom_line(aes(group=row_id),alpha=0.8) + \n  facet_wrap(~ marble_name,nrow=8) +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# track length doesnt affect performance\n\nSo from the above it was quite clear that the track length doesnt really affect the performance. This should have been obvious from the way each marble gets lifted back to her higher elevation, thereby restoring the gravitational energy within it.\n\n\n\nThe idea behind the moneyball theory was to use undervalued statistics to win the game.

Now we need to formulate a way to decide whether a team selected by that statistic will win or not. For that I thought of modeling a simple bivariate distribution, preferrably that can model the probability that marble X and marble Y can win like this. $P_{X,Y}(X,Y) = {} $\nBut the problem now was how do I define winning? Would simply saying first place be enough? Then the probabilities will be tilted towards some marbles. Or would it be better to be broad and say winning can mean being in the top 3 positions. So now with that in mind, we have a discrete bivariate distribution that we want to find the exact or approximate probabilities of. Now the problem has become, how do we find the probabilities when we have really limited amount of data. One thought that came to my mind was to simulate a race and then estimate the probabilities of winning by Monte Carlo simulations. Simply put, we would similating many races with different team combinations and from them we try to calculate the relative probability that a team with X and Y has earned enough points to be in the top 3 positions.\n\n\n\nHere is where i hit the biggest problem. Let me summarize\nThere are 32 marbles.\nA team can have 2 members.\nHow many team combinations are possible? \\(^{32}C_{2} = \\frac{32!}{2! * 30!} = 496\\)\nAnd then came another problem, my first idea was to find \\(^{496}C_{16}\\) combinations but there would be conflicts as team combinations may have the same player in different teams.\nFrom there on I thought of not going for the team combinations and instead thought of the player combinations in a race. Which ended up in an even worse dead end unfortunately as \\(^{32}C_{16} = 601080390\\) which meant that I’d have to simulate 601,080,390(six hundred one million eighty thousand three hundred ninety) races. (By simulating my intial thought was to regress the time that a player would take on a race and then sort by the time and award points accordingly. Here also I was lost as to whether the method would be feasible for such a large number of simulations.)\nWith that concludes my attempt at the tidy tuesday dataset, I learned a lot from it, but there were more questions unanswered than answered."

For that I thought of modeling a simple bivariate distribution, preferrably that can model the probability that marble X and marble Y can win like this. $P_{X,Y}(X,Y) = {} $\nBut the problem now was how do I define winning? Would simply saying first place be enough? Then the probabilities will be tilted towards some marbles. Or would it be better to be broad and say winning can mean being in the top 3 positions. So now with that in mind, we have a discrete bivariate distribution that we want to find the exact or approximate probabilities of. Now the problem has become, how do we find the probabilities when we have really limited amount of data. One thought that came to my mind was to simulate a race and then estimate the probabilities of winning by Monte Carlo simulations. Simply put, we would similating many races with different team combinations and from them we try to calculate the relative probability that a team with X and Y has earned enough points to be in the top 3 positions."

    "text": "Here is where i hit the biggest problem. Let me summarize\nThere are 32 marbles.\nA team can have 2 members.\nHow many team combinations are possible? \\(^{32}C_{2} = \\frac{32!}{2! * 30!} = 496\\)\nAnd then came another problem, my first idea was to find \\(^{496}C_{16}\\) combinations but there would be conflicts as team combinations may have the same player in different teams.\nFrom there on I thought of not going for the team combinations and instead thought of the player combinations in a race. Which ended up in an even worse dead end unfortunately as \\(^{32}C_{16} = 601080390\\) which meant that I’d have to simulate 601,080,390(six hundred one million eighty thousand three hundred ninety) races. (By simulating my intial thought was to regress the time that a player would take on a race and then sort by the time and award points accordingly. Here also I was lost as to whether the method would be feasible for such a large number of simulations.)\nWith that concludes my attempt at the tidy tuesday dataset, I learned a lot from it, but there were more questions unanswered than answered."

    "section": "The project",
    "text": "The project\nI received the chance to work in this project through my girlfriend who was working in a production branch of a digital marketing agency (hereon referred to as EyeAngle). The project was simple. EyeAngle has been working with a client (hereon referred to as University of Liverpool) for a long time and the time had come for UoL to take in a new set of candidates into their environment. EyeAngle had worked on producing videos for social media content such as testimonials, teaser trailers and together with the parent company EyeAngle+ had run a campaign to recruit more candidates into UoL. Now the time has come to take the data that was collected in the process and analyse to present to the client of the success of the project. That was what I knew at first glance and I accepted the opportunity (this was in a period where everyone was quarantining in the middle of a pandemic, and I needed a project that was exciting as this to keep myself sane)\nNow before beginning on the task, I had to take a look at what sort of data was available for me. The supervisor of this project (hereon referred to as the Provost) informed me with the data that they have collected and what are the data that needs to be collected.\n\nThe data\n\nGoogly Data\nTo explain the sources of data, one must get to know the story behind how the data was collected. And here is where Google Analytics come into play.\nFrom the start of the campaign social media content has been posted on two platforms. Facebook and Instagram. Each social media content that was posted during the campaign had a link for potential candidates to sign up for the interview. The links had Google Analytics tracking attached with it (in the case of Instagram the links were all funnelled through the bio and in the case of Facebook the links with tracking codes were shortened and added as part of the post content). From that source a variety of data was collected. I didn’t receive access to the direct Google Analytics data because that would have been risky. Instead I received access to a Google Data Studio dashboard.\nNow from this dashboard I had to slowly collect data by setting the date and then downloading the CSV’s related to each of the three graphs that were present.\nAfter downloading a few files I realised that combining all of these into dataframe is going to be a massive collection of rbind codes. Therefore I googled a bit about how R gives out contents of a directory and lo and behold it was a list. quickly loads purrr library How convenient, I can simply put each of the three CSV’s that come under each date into a folder named with that date and then combine them all together by mapping through the list of files. The result was the following code.\n\napplication_conversion_rate &lt;- map_dfr(dir_ls(\"raw_data/\"),\n                                       ~ read_csv(dir_info(.x)$path[1]) %&gt;% \n                                         mutate(date = gsub(\"raw_data/\",\"\",.x)))\napplications &lt;- map_dfr(dir_ls(\"raw_data/\"),\n                        ~ read_csv(dir_info(.x)$path[2]) %&gt;% \n                          mutate(date = gsub(\"raw_data/\",\"\",.x)))\ncampaign_data &lt;- map_dfr(dir_ls(\"raw_data/\"),\n                         ~ read_csv(dir_info(.x)$path[3]) %&gt;% \n                           mutate(date = gsub(\"raw_data/\",\"\",.x)))\n\nwrite_csv(application_conversion_rate,\"combined_data/application_conversion_rate.csv\")\nwrite_csv(applications,\"combined_data/applications.csv\")\nwrite_csv(campaign_data,\"combined_data/campaign_data.csv\")\n\nAfter inspecting the final combined dataset I gained an understanding of what sort of data I have with me right now. In summary, I know in a particular date how many users clicked on the signup link on a SM post and then how many of them signed up using that link, in addition I also knew where these users came from and whether they came from an advertisement or simply from a SM post. So that was one dataset under my belt. I felt like a coding ninja using purrr, and as all good things go, my dopamine levels were about to make a massive hit after encountering the next source of data.\n\n\nSuper Data\nRemember how I mentioned paid advertisements? well there was the next catch. The Provost at the start of the project informed me that I will not be working alone in this project, and that there will be two people from EyeAngle working with me. Those two were simply my girlfriend and a really close friend of hers. Both of them were competent in R, Excel and were excellent content writers. But here I had the next problem that I never faced before.\n\n\nPitfall #1: Collaborative Google Slides with R\nAt the time being the only option was to use Rstudio cloud as an option for collaborative data analysis but the issue that came up next was that the final report needed to be made in Google Slides for several reasons such as convienience, collaborative real time editing and suggesting etc. This I knew would become a tedious two step process, as I would have to run the R script locally and then create the graph and ggsave it and then paste it on to the Google Slide and adjust it accordingly. There was no other option for me but to stick with this method.\nMoving forward from that the next task that the provost set forward for me was to collect data about the Facebook ad campaigns. There I learned about another tool on collecting data called Supermetrics.\nSupermetrics is free for use as a trial for 14 days and since I was supposed to submit this within less than 14 days I was able to use the free version as the provost told me. As per his instructions I set up a Google Sheet and then started by adding the Supermetrics addon to Google Sheets. It took me and the rest of the team two days to completely understand how the queries run from Supermetrics and what were the resulting data coming from. This was where knowing a bit about SQL helped to underestand what Supermetrics was trying to bring and from where. Finally after a few trial and error and a bundle of extra sheets in the Sheets workbook we managed to get the data into one place. ### Cleaning and wrangling\nAnd so began the journey into the muddy waters of data wrangling. It was tedious at first considering that we had to download Google sheets as csv files and then gather them all together into one place. Which brings us to the next pitfall that we faced in doing this project.\n\n\nPitfall #2: Lack of streamlined data pipelines\nWe didnt have a proper data pipeline to ensure that when we update the query in Supermetrics to refresh the data, the changes would be automatically reflected in our graphs. The intermediate step of having to download the data from Google Sheets locally as CSV files was the bottleneck of it all. It would have been much easier if we used the R package for handling Google Sheets and used it to auto update the graphs.\n\n\nPitfall #3: Data version control\nIn addition to these we also had the issue of data version control. Because what happened halfway through the entire scene was that we realized that there were missing pieces in the data because of a misconfiguration in the Supermetrics query. This would lead to the classic nightmare of having multiple datasets with the suffix if -1,-2,-new etc. This was a perfect recipe for disaster and the antidote would have been pretty obvious. Yes git would have been an option and that was where my stupidity came into place. I didn’t set up a local git repo to track the changes in the csv files so that we can revert back whenever we wanted. If we had switched to using Google Sheets package to get the synced data then version controlling would be given through the version history in Google Sheets. Regardless this was the biggest misconception I had back then. I would assume git repos need to be in github and local repos without a remote weren’t a thing. Butt after finishing the project only I realized how easy it would have been to manage the entire process if I had the common sense to just type git init and get on with the rest of the work.\nThe rest was it a blur of plots and late night calls to adjust different values according to the customer need and then the final presentation was done and everything was history."

The project has been continuously running for two years upto now(2022) and has collected over 800 observations. The project was initially brought forward by Dr. Thiyanga Talagala and I recieved the opportunity to work on this project as part of the Hacktoberfest challenge in the year 2020. There I learned how to setup vignettes and packagedown websites along with many aspects of data cleaning. Afterwards I recieved the opportunity to work on this project once again as part of my work as a consultant in the Statistical Consultancy Service unit in the Department of Statistics, University of Sri Jayewardenepura. There my main obligation was to curate a new set of observations for the year 2021 by working with a group of consultants. The dataset was collected manually and cleaned through R in a reproducible manner to be published as a data package on CRAN with over 1000+ downloads in total.\nGithub CRAN\n\n\nscatteR\nscatteR is a novel data generating method that is based on scagnostics. This was developed during my undergraduate research to assist in my thesis. Scagnostics are a graphical exploratory tool that is capable of quantifying the features of scatterplot through nine measurements that are calculated using three geometrical graphs. scatteR acts as an inverse scagnostics method by iteratively arranging points on a unit 2 dimensional space. The points are placed to minimize the distance between the existing and expected scagnostic measurements through simulated annealing as an optimization method.\nFor more info about scatteR check out the useR presentation slides.\nGithub CRAN\n\n\nnic\nNature Inspired Color palettes came up as a project to work upon for the Hacktoberfest challenge for the year 2021. This project provided me with the opportunity to work on gathering data by collecting photos from my garden, quantisizing images to generate the most frequent colors, analyse color frequency based on color spaces, and finally generate color palletes that are colorblind friendly.\nGithub CRAN\n\n\ntsdataleaks\nThis project came up as part of the Hacktoberfest challenge in 2021. The main aim of my work was to optimize the performance of the calculations conducted in the package. tsdataleaks is concerned with capturing the data leaks between time series in mutlivariate time series.

    "text": "“Imagine you are opening the lock on your brand new home and coming in after a long day of work to see the house all cleaned up nicely. The love of your life, the perfect man for you, is in the kitchen making dinner with the two children and having a grand time.” Said the fairy god mother to the girl on her bed.\nThe girl wiped the tears from the bloodshot eyes. “Stop, stop, please, those stuff used to give me the happiness I needed, but I have been run over by life to know that none of it is going to be true.” She stammered and curled up into a ball, hugging herself.\n“Well sweetie, I’m just a fairy god mother that’s part of your imagination. I’m not a genie to give you all that you want, goodness me, and people who believe that their problems can be solved by genies are the worst of them all. So ungrateful, I tell you.” The fairy god mother frowned and shook her head in disbelief.\n“I don’t want to hear about other people! Can’t you see I’m in pain. Life hasn’t given me anything to be happy about. I’m miserable and desperate and that’s why I called you for help. Please can you focus on me for one second.” She broke into tears again as she stammered those words from her mouth. The fairy god mother looked at her with concern in her eyes, her shimmering wings fluttered softly, a clear sign that she was under pressure.\n“What can I offer you? Other than my words of a world where things would be better. I can tell you how good the light at the end of the tunnel is, but only you know where you want to make the tunnel end. Once I was the best thing that ever happened in your life, and now I am nothing more than an evil liar, a cunning manipulator, who simply lulled you into a trap of fake reality.” The fairy god mother sighed and let her wings relax.\n“I did what I could do, I’m only a part of your imagination, so close yet so far away from you, a presence that can only be felt but never seen or touched. I can still assure you that there is still hope left to fight for, that there is some good in this world to live and take another step. But it’s much easier for you to just give in and curse the entire world.” She got up from the girl’s bedside and walked towards the window. “If ever you need to feel hope in this world, call my name and I shall be by your side, but to turn that hope into a reality, you need to get out of that bed and wipe those tears away.”\nTurning around, the fairy god mother saw the anger in the little girl’s eyes. “Go! Go away then! Leave me as everyone else does! You were a liar all this time. You just wanted to manipulate me and keep me in place. You wanted to use me to feed your ego! That was all that you were, nothing more.” The little girl screamed from on top of the bed with hot tears streaming down her face.\n“Those who weave the prettiest dreams are the ones who are hated the most when it’s time to wake up” And with a slight breeze the fairy god mother was gone, and the little girl was left with her broken heart."

    "text": "It was a chilly night in the bustling city of Vasco. The shops and windows that were wide open in the morning were now shut and dark. The street lamps brought an eerie blue light on to the muddy roads. Snow was falling faintly with a slight breeze adding in to the cold gloominess of the entire city.\nAmidst all of this, a man was walking among these streets tonight. His stride is purposeful yet his glances showed hesitation and fear. But the only thing to fear at a time like these were marauders and animals and neither of them were reported in this area for a long time now.\nHe hugged the black coat even closer towards him as a chilly breeze swept past him. The snow was spreading the mud all around the road leaving his boots gathering more brown than black. His gloved hands went inside his coat pocket to fish out a pocket watch made out of silver. With a simple flick he opened the lid of the pocket watch to peer inside. The frost has crept into the glass on the inside and with a delicate gloved finger he brushed the frost away to look at the time. 15 minutes past 8 in the night. He ran a finger delicately over the edge of the pocket watch watching how the clock began to imitate his fidgeting glances.\n“This is going to be a long night” (He whispers to himself with a sigh.)\nThis was a time where many went to their beds after working all day long and for some it was the time they were awake after spending their entire morning in bed.\nYet now was the time that he had to be the most vigilant. His pace slowed down to a halt and his fidgeting glances only increased in frequency.\n“One, Two, Three, Dang it, did I count that lamp again?” (He angrily says this)\nHe began counting the number of street lamps from the start of the lane he was in. Only a couple of houses were nearby and all of them were pitch black with no light inside.\nA sign up ahead of him read “Crossroads lane”.\nThe location seemed correct and the time was right as discussed.\n“Where the hell is that bastard?” (he said under his breath).\nAs if on cue, a cold breeze swept through the road he was in. He readjusted his hat and brought his coat closer to himself. The cold breeze grew in intensity until the snow was falling thick to where he was standing. The air around him thickened and his vision was clouded by a fog that wrapped around him. Out of the foggy white smoke, a pale figure came forward.\nThe figure was dressed in silky ephemeral robes of white, with a dimly glowing ring of blue fixed around his forehead. His eyes were not visible as his face was covered in a mask.\nIt was a peculiar mask. A mask with no facial expressions, a mask without a mouth or nose. It was the mask worn by the Unforgiven. The symbolic duel ended scythe was tied to his back, as the ice cold steel glinted in the moonlight.\nThe Unforgiven came forward and stood a feet away from the man in the cloak. With a nod the man brought forward a small wooden dice. The Unforgiven smiled from the corner of his lips (and whispered) “Is that all you can bring as ransom for your daughter”\n“You wouldn’t have thought lightly of what I’m parting with, if you knew what this can be used for.” (The man replied in anger)\n“Pathetic. You actually thought you are more educated than an Unforgiven. I know what this dice is capable of, and I know when and where it was made. What this dice can do, I can easily do by myself. I have no use for a mere fortune telling dice. We are the Unforgiven, we were not forgiven for knowing everything needed and unneeded. I don’t think this will be an enough ransom, Mr. Randy” (Disappointed tone)\n“Please, don’t do that, please, I want my Lizzie back. Oh please don’t do anything to her, I beg you.” (in a crying tone)\n“Do not worry, your daughter is in the right hands, no harm shall befall her. If you want to rescue her from our efforts and help, then by all means bring forth a ransom that is worthy of the amount that I told you earlier, Mr. Randy. I shall give you one more chance at redemption, but if you fail next time, I will make sure that my Isilgar shall leave an unforgettable kiss to your neck.” (chuckles lightly)\nThe Unforgiven brought his double ended scythe, Isilgar to the Randy’s neck in a sweeping motion and lets it rest there. Randy gazed into the empty mask of the Unforgiven and nods, feeling the cold blade graze his neck.\n“Good day to you Mr. Randy, I shall carry the message of your incompetence to your daughter.”(grim tone)\nIn one swift click the Isilgar was back in its sheath, and the Unforgiven took a few steps back. Randy stared in horror as the mist started to cloud his vision and the Unforgiven was no more."

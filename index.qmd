  <span>Welcome fellow wanderer,
  <br/>
  You have stumbled upon the many stories that I,
  <br/>
  have written with the few breaths left in my life.</span>
  <br/>

  <span>If there is anything that you can take away from this website,
  <br/>
  let it be that in a world full of perfectly generated and curated content,
  <br/>
  being human by making mistakes
  <br/>
  lets your creation be more genuine and heart felt.</span>
  <br/>

  <span>In return if there is one thing I can ask from you,
  <br/>
  my dear visitor,
  <br/>
  is to tread gently through these pages
  <br/>
  and treat them with compassion, empathy and understanding,
  <br/>
  for every page is a collection of the limited time in my life,
  <br/>
  that I have dedicated to.</span>
  <br/>

  <span>With that being said,
  <br/>
  wander on to the creative content section to feed your imagination,
  <br/>
  Or read up on my history in my CV <a href="Portfolio.pdf">here.</a> </span>

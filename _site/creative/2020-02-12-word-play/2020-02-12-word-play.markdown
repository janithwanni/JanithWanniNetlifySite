## A

An aspiring arsonist  
Actively availing an ailment   
Avoiding an atypical life  
Angered by the aristocracy  
And the altruistic   
Avenging the alienated  
To avert an apocalypse  
Ascending to an astral area  
Anonymity was not amiss  
Yet the anomaly was apparent  
His attempt was in accord  
To get the accolade   
Of the angels above him  
All angles were approached  
And in the end  
An apparition was all there was  
An abyss staring back at him

## F

A Fickle frail fragile mind  
A facade for a few  
a facet of truth for the favored   
Flooded with fear of falling  
Into a fog of faint feelings  
Fixations into the far  
Bringing frustrations  
Drawing fractals in a flow   
Of formidable fortitude  
Throwing the fidgeting mind  
Out of focus  
Finishing it in furious flames

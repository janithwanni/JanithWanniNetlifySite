My interest for interpretable machine learning began with my final year research project, titled “Transparency, auditability and explainability of interpretable machine learning methods”. The research project wouldn’t have been a success if not for the guidance and supervision of Dr. Thiyanga Talagala. From the very first datathon that she mentored me in, she has been an inspirational character in my university life, pushing me to think out of the box and find novel solutions to problems.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, the lecturers of the department of statistics has been super helpful in nurturing my knowledge of statistics and providing me the opportunity to explore new avenues in applying statistics.\n\n\nOn this website you will find some of my work and interests in statistics and creative writing. If you find anything out of place or worth mentioning to me, please contact me through my socials. If you want to learn more about my academic and professional background, check out my Resume below.\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nGithub\n\n\nLinkedin\n\n\nEmail\n\n\nResume\n\n\n\nWith that being said, here are some of my interests that I don’t get to talk about a lot.\nMy current obsessions\nGenshin Impact\n\n\nGenshin Impact is a video game that I have been playing for almost an year now. The main things I love about the game are the stunning visuals, the art style and the music along with the gripping and creative story line. Since it’s mostly a single player game, I can play without any pressure of internet speed or skill level. My most favorite character of all is Eula, and these days I’m bulding up two other favorite characters, Candace and Shikanoin Heizou.\n\n\n\n\nFountain pens and Notebooks\n\n\nMy love for fountain pens began with my obsession with calligraphy and cursive writing. From the early days I have collected several starter level fountain pens, listed in chronoligcal order as follows.\nHero Fountain Pen\nTWSBI Eco pen\nParker Vector\nJinhao X750\nJinhao X550\nCurrently, I’m still using Noodler’s Bernanke Black as my primary ink and Daycraft dotted notebook as my paper medium. Here are some snaps of the various pens and notebooks that I have used upto now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Writing is an area that I’m really interested in and so is contributing new areas of improvements in the data science community. Here are some of my publications that I have written over the years.\nscatteR: Generating instance space using scagnostics\nPresented scatteR in theSynthetic Data and Text Analysis session in useR! 2022 as a diversity scholarship winner\nPublished scatteR as a preprint article in arXiv arXiv:2209.06682 (stat.CO)\nIntelligent System to Verify the Effectiveness of Proposed Teacher Transfers Incorporating Human Factors\nThis was a project that I assisted with during my second year of the Bachelor’s degree. The study explored the satisfaction of teachers who were transferred to new schools for various reasons through the use of machine learning techniques. I was able to put the machine learning knowledge I had acquired up to then into a real life scenario. The process of data cleaning, communicating with team members and explaining the machine learning concepts in layman terms were challenging components that I enjoyed immensely.\nPaper\nPackages\nI firmly believe that software should also be considered as research considering the amount of work that is taken into building each software product. I worked mainly with Python and C++ and later transitioned to R and Julia as well yet from all these languages the R ecosystem gave me the easiest and straightforward method of bringing my ideas into a software package for the use of others.\nDSJobtracker\nDSJobtracker is a data package containing the job requirements for Data science jobs all around the world. The project has been continuously running for two years upto now(2022) and has collected over 800 observations. The project was initially brought forward by Dr. Thiyanga Talagala and I recieved the opportunity to work on this project as part of the Hacktoberfest challenge in the year 2020. There I learned how to setup vignettes and packagedown websites along with many aspects of data cleaning. Afterwards I recieved the opportunity to work on this project once again as part of my work as a consultant in the Statistical Consultancy Service unit in the Department of Statistics, University of Sri Jayewardenepura. There my main obligation was to curate a new set of observations for the year 2021 by working with a group of consultants. The dataset was collected manually and cleaned through R in a reproducible manner to be published as a data package on CRAN with over 1000+ downloads in total.\nGithub\nCRAN\nscatteR\nscatteR is a novel data generating method that is based on scagnostics. This was developed during my undergraduate research to assist in my thesis. Scagnostics are a graphical exploratory tool that is capable of quantifying the features of scatterplot through nine measurements that are calculated using three geometrical graphs. scatteR acts as an inverse scagnostics method by iteratively arranging points on a unit 2 dimensional space. The points are placed to minimize the distance between the existing and expected scagnostic measurements through simulated annealing as an optimization method.\nFor more info about scatteR check out the useR presentation slides.\nGithub\nCRAN\nnic\nNature Inspired Color palettes came up as a project to work upon for the Hacktoberfest challenge for the year 2021. This project provided me with the opportunity to work on gathering data by collecting photos from my garden, quantisizing images to generate the most frequent colors, analyse color frequency based on color spaces, and finally generate color palletes that are colorblind friendly.\nGithub\nCRAN\ntsdataleaks\nThis project came up as part of the Hacktoberfest challenge in 2021. The main aim of my work was to optimize the performance of the calculations conducted in the package. tsdataleaks is concerned with capturing the data leaks between time series in mutlivariate time series. Through these project I was able to learn about RCpp and the internal operations of R that utilize the vectorized operations.\nGithub\nCRAN\n\n\n\n",

These are some of the places where I got the opportunity to share my knowledge publicly.\nAbuja useR Group September 2022 meetup\n\nDr. Stephen Balogun was my coordinator for the useR! 2022 conference and after the conference, I received an invite to speak with the Abuja R user group on September 2022. The topic that I chose for the talk was based on a recent technical assessment I had performed where I had to learn the techniques and intricacies of creating an interactive map within a Shiny dashboard. Since knowledge is best retained when shared, I decided to do a session on implementing leaflet maps in Shiny dashboards.\nSlides\nShiny application\nRLadiesColombo April 2021 meetup\n\nThe RLadies initiative interested me from the beginning when I was introduced to it on the very first lecture with Dr. Thiyanga Talagala. Even though I was scared to engage with the community as my initial thought was that I would not be welcome there, I joined my first RLadies meetup with the Plot a lot with ggplot2 workshop done by Priyanga and Thiyanga Talagala. After a few months, I myself received the opportunity to present my knowledge on Data Wrangling in R at the April Meetup of RLadies Colombo.\nThe idea that I wanted to follow in this session was to stray away from the standard workshop format of introducing several functions in a specific package and instead wanted to give a real life scenario where these functions will be used. I had a firm belief that people tend to learn things when they use it in a practical context that means something to them. Hence I used the idea of asking the audience to imagine that they are an intern at Spotify and that they are assigned different tasks that require the specific use of a data wrangling function in the dplyr,tidyr and lubridate packages.\n\n\n@RLadiesColombo just finished another fantastic meetup session. Thank you @janithcwanni for that awesome session on Data wrangling with R 👏👏👏🎉. #rstats #DataWrangling #DataScience #rladies Janith's slides here: https://t.co/kuaCX3ca95 pic.twitter.com/X2p0yhc4VG\n\n— R-Ladies Colombo (@RLadiesColombo) April 22, 2021\n\nSlides\nTensorflow All Around 2019\nTensorflow All Around was an event organized by the Tensorflow User Group of Sri Lanka parallel to similar events organized all through out the globe. I was the head of the Tensorflow User Group of Sri Lanka during this period and I took the initiative to organize the event and presented a talk on using Tensorflow.js for sentiment analysis on the browser. There were over 30 participants who followed along with the talk by trying out the different components of setting up Tensorflow.js on a webpage and classifying sentiment of text collected through an API call with the help of a Universal Sentence Encoder.\n\nGithub\nSlides\nGoogle Developer Group ML Bootcamp 2019\nThis was my first talk in the Google Developer Group in Sri Lanka, where I was helping out a two day bootcamp by providing two sessions. One session was in helping the audience understand loss functions and the other session was on RNNs for sequential data. The audience consisted of many professionals in the Software industry and they were quite enthusiastic on using the concepts that were taught during the sessions. Both sessions were conducted using Python and Tensorflow.\n\n\n\n\nMachine Learning Bootcamp is happening on the 23rd and 24th February organized by @GDGLK and @SLASSCOM Technology Forum at @wso2 Trace Expert City office, Sri Lanka.

The core conceptof the paper was summarized and contained within a short video for researchers to watch and gain a highlevel idea of the inner workings of the RETRO model.\nPaper\nRecording\nEDEX presentation on Sports Analytics on Netball\nAs an initiave of the Sports Analytics Unit of University of Sri Jayewardenepura, a data entry application was to be built for the Sri Lankan Netball team. In this project I built the data entry application using R Shiny and a Microsoft Azure SQL database. The architecture and the thought process behind the app development was shared in EDEX, an annual higher studies exhibition organized by the Royal College Union.\n\n\n\nFacebook Video\nSlide\nFundamentals of Data Visualization\nDuring my time as the President of the Statistics Society, I decided to initiate a data visualization competition called Pearl Viz. The inspiration for the name came from Iron Viz, the annual data visualization competition organized by Tableau and since Sri Lanka is known as the Pearl of the Indian Ocean. Data visualization is a skill that most statistics undergraduates obtain in their first year in the university. However, the tools that were used for data visualization in the classroom was limited by their performance and sharing capabilities. Therefore new visualization technologies should be introduced if the students were to take on the task of providing visualizations using modern Business Intelligence tools. To introduce students to these tools along with the Do’s and Dont’s of data visualization, I organized a short webinar on the Fundamentals of Data Visualization. As a live demo I took a wireframe sketch of a dashboard based on the career of the popular pop artist P!nk and turned it into a shareable interactive web based dashboard using Google Data Studio.\n\n\nSlides\nRecording\nData Visualization in Tableau\nAs the next step of preparing students to modern BI tools, I decided to give a small tutorial on Tableau, specifically Tableau Public and Tableau Cloud, two free data visualization tools that undergraduates can use to learn and enhance their skills to be better prepared for the industry. In this instance a live demo was done using the starter demo dataset from Tableau on the amount of \\(\\text{CO}_2\\) emmisions while another live demo was done using an movie profit and review dataset.\n\nSlides\nRecording\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nArticles\nPublish or perish is an extreme outlook on the craft of writing. I\nwork on my publications not to stay afloat but to enjoy the waves.\nWriting is an area that I’m really interested in and so is contributing\nnew areas of improvements in the data science community. Here are some\nof my publications that I have written over the years.\nscatteR:\nGenerating instance space using scagnostics\nAbout to be presented at useR!\n2022\nIntelligent\nSystem to Verify the Effectiveness of Proposed Teacher Transfers\nIncorporating Human Factors\nThis was a project that I assisted with during my second year of the\nBachelor’s degree. The study explored the satisfaction of teachers who\nwere transferred to new schools for various reasons through the use of\nmachine learning techniques. I was able to put the machine learning\nknowledge I had acquired up to then into a real life scenario. The\nprocess of data cleaning, communicating with team members and explaining\nthe machine learning concepts in layman terms were challenging\ncomponents that I enjoyed immensely.\nPaper\nPackages\nI firmly believe that software should also be considered as research\nconsidering the amount of work that is taken into building each software\nproduct. I worked mainly with Python and C++ and later transitioned to R\nand Julia as well yet from all these languages the R ecosystem gave me\nthe easiest and straightforward method of bringing my ideas into a\nsoftware package for the use of others.\nDSJobtracker\nDSJobtracker is a data package containing the job requirements for\nData science jobs all around the world. The project has been\ncontinuously running for two years upto now(2022) and has collected over\n800 observations. The project was initially brought forward by\nDr. Thiyanga Talagala and I recieved the opportunity to work on this\nproject as part of the Hacktoberfest challenge in the year 2020. There I\nlearned how to setup vignettes and packagedown websites along with many\naspects of data cleaning. Afterwards I recieved the opportunity to work\non this project once again as part of my work as a consultant in the\nStatistical Consultancy Service unit in the Department of Statistics,\nUniversity of Sri Jayewardenepura. There my main obligation was to\ncurate a new set of observations for the year 2021 by working with a\ngroup of consultants. The dataset was collected manually and cleaned\nthrough R in a reproducible manner to be published as a data package on\nCRAN with over 1000+ downloads in total.\nGithub\nscatteR\nscatteR is a novel data generating method that is based on\nscagnostics. This was developed during my undergraduate research to\nassist in my thesis. Scagnostics are a graphical exploratory tool that\nis capable of quantifying the features of scatterplot through nine\nmeasurements that are calculated using three geometrical graphs. scatteR\nacts as an inverse scagnostics method by iteratively arranging points on\na unit 2 dimensional space. The points are placed to minimize the\ndistance between the existing and expected scagnostic measurements\nthrough simulated annealing as an optimization method.\nFor more info about scatteR check out the useR\npresentation slides.\nGithub\nnic\nNature Inspired Color palettes came up as a project to work upon for\nthe Hacktoberfest challenge for the year 2021. This project provided me\nwith the opportunity to work on gathering data by collecting photos from\nmy garden, quantisizing images to generate the most frequent colors,\nanalyse color frequency based on color spaces, and finally generate\ncolor palletes that are colorblind friendly.\nGithub\ntsdataleaks\nThis project came up as part of the Hacktoberfest challenge in 2021.\nThe main aim of my work was to optimize the performance of the\ncalculations conducted in the package. tsdataleaks is concerned with\ncapturing the data leaks between time series in mutlivariate time\nseries. Through these project I was able to learn about RCpp and the\ninternal operations of R that utilize the vectorized operations.\nGithub\n\n\n\n",

These\nare some of the places where I got the opportunity to share my knowledge\npublicly.\nRLadiesColombo April 2021\nmeetup\n\nThe RLadies initiative interested me from the beginning when I was\nintroduced to it on the very first lecture with Dr. Thiyanga Talagala.\nEven though I was scared to engage with the community as my initial\nthought was that I would not be welcome there, I joined my first RLadies\nmeetup with the Plot a lot with ggplot2 workshop done by Priyanga and\nThiyanga Talagala. After a few months, I myself received the opportunity\nto present my knowledge on Data Wrangling in R at the April Meetup of\nRLadies Colombo.\nThe idea that I wanted to follow in this session was to stray away\nfrom the standard workshop format of introducing several functions in a\nspecific package and instead wanted to give a real life scenario where\nthese functions will be used. I had a firm belief that people tend to\nlearn things when they use it in a practical context that means\nsomething to them. Hence I used the idea of asking the audience to\nimagine that they are an intern at Spotify and that they are assigned\ndifferent tasks that require the specific use of a data wrangling\nfunction in the dplyr,tidyr and lubridate packages.\n\n\n@RLadiesColombo\njust finished another fantastic meetup session. Thank you\n@janithcwanni for\nthat awesome session on Data wrangling with R 👏👏👏🎉.\n#rstats\n#DataWrangling\n#DataScience\n#rladies\nJanith's slides here:\nhttps://t.co/kuaCX3ca95\npic.twitter.com/X2p0yhc4VG\n\n— R-Ladies Colombo (@RLadiesColombo)\nApril\n22, 2021\n\nSlides\nTensorflow All Around 2019\nTensorflow All Around was an event organized by the Tensorflow User\nGroup of Sri Lanka parallel to similar events organized all through out\nthe globe. I was the head of the Tensorflow User Group of Sri Lanka\nduring this period and I took the initiative to organize the event and\npresented a talk on using Tensorflow.js for sentiment analysis on the\nbrowser. There were over 30 participants who followed along with the\ntalk by trying out the different components of setting up Tensorflow.js\non a webpage and classifying sentiment of text collected through an API\ncall with the help of a Universal Sentence Encoder.\n\nGithub Slides\nGoogle Developer Group\nML Bootcamp 2019\nThis was my first talk in the Google Developer Group in Sri Lanka,\nwhere I was helping out a two day bootcamp by providing two sessions.\nOne session was in helping the audience understand loss functions and\nthe other session was on RNNs for sequential data. The audience\nconsisted of many professionals in the Software industry and they were\nquite enthusiastic on using the concepts that were taught during the\nsessions. Both sessions were conducted using Python and Tensorflow.\n\n\n\n\nMachine Learning Bootcamp is happening on the 23rd and 24th February\norganized by\n@GDGLK and\n@SLASSCOM Technology\nForum at @wso2 Trace Expert City\noffice, Sri Lanka.

The core\nconceptof the paper was summarized and contained within a short video\nfor researchers to watch and gain a highlevel idea of the inner workings\nof the RETRO model.\nPaper\nRecording\nEDEX\npresentation on Sports Analytics on Netball\nAs an initiave of the Sports Analytics Unit of University of Sri\nJayewardenepura, a data entry application was to be built for the Sri\nLankan Netball team. In this project I built the data entry application\nusing R Shiny and a Microsoft Azure SQL database. The architecture and\nthe thought process behind the app development was shared in EDEX, an\nannual higher studies exhibition organized by the Royal College\nUnion.\n\n\n\nFacebook\nVideo Slide\nFundamentals of Data\nVisualization\nDuring my time as the President of the Statistics Society, I decided\nto initiate a data visualization competition called Pearl Viz. The\ninspiration for the name came from Iron Viz, the annual data\nvisualization competition organized by Tableau and since Sri Lanka is\nknown as the Pearl of the Indian Ocean. Data visualization is a skill\nthat most statistics undergraduates obtain in their first year in the\nuniversity. However, the tools that were used for data visualization in\nthe classroom was limited by their performance and sharing capabilities.\nTherefore new visualization technologies should be introduced if the\nstudents were to take on the task of providing visualizations using\nmodern Business Intelligence tools. To introduce students to these tools\nalong with the Do’s and Dont’s of data visualization, I organized a\nshort webinar on the Fundamentals of Data Visualization. As a live demo\nI took a wireframe sketch of a dashboard based on the career of the\npopular pop artist P!nk and turned it into a shareable interactive web\nbased dashboard using Google Data Studio.\n\n\nSlides\nRecording\nData Visualization in\nTableau\nAs the next step of preparing students to modern BI tools, I decided\nto give a small tutorial on Tableau, specifically Tableau Public and\nTableau Cloud, two free data visualization tools that undergraduates can\nuse to learn and enhance their skills to be better prepared for the\nindustry. In this instance a live demo was done using the starter demo\ndataset from Tableau on the amount of \\(\\text{CO}_2\\) emmisions while another live\ndemo was done using an movie profit and review dataset.\n\nSlides\nRecording\n\n\n\n",
